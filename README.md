# Climate-Discourse-Analysis-Machine-Learning-NLP-for-Stance-Detection

This project explores online discussions about climate change, using Reddit posts as the primary data source.

The goal is to distinguish between two key themes:
1. Climate Science – posts that discuss scientific research, evidence, and data.
2. Climate Action – posts focused on activism, policies, and solutions.

By analyzing how these themes are talked about in public conversations, the project aims to provide means to understand how climate change is discussed and acted upon in digital spaces. The project combines traditional machine learning techniques with modern transformer-based NLP models to evaluate performance across approaches:
1. Classical ML models: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machines
2. Transformer models: BERT and other state-of-the-art language models

Objectives:
1. Build and compare classifiers for distinguishing climate science vs. climate action posts.
2. Evaluate trade-offs between traditional ML and transformer models.
3. Provide insights into how scientific and activist perspectives are represented in climate change discourse online.

Features:
1. Preprocessing pipeline for Reddit text data
2. Benchmarking multiple ML and transformer-based models
3. Metrics for performance evaluation and comparison
4. Modular, reproducible code for extension or adaptation to similar text classification tasks

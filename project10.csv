"241676","kg6qqj5",2,"How the tech works

The RMIT team, with lead author and PhD researcher Karma Zuraiqi, employed thermal chemistry methods widely used by industry in their development of the new CCS tech.

The ""bubble column"" method starts with liquid metal being heated to about 100-120C.

Carbon dioxide is injected into the liquid metal, with the gas bubbles rising up just like bubbles in a champagne glass.

As the bubbles move through the liquid metal, the gas molecule splits up to form flakes of solid carbon, with the reaction taking just a split second.

""It's the extraordinary speed of the chemical reaction we have achieved that makes our technology commercially viable, where so many alternative approaches have struggled,"" Chiang said.

The next stage in the research is scaling up the proof-of-concept to a modularized prototype the size of a shipping container, in collaboration with industry partner ABR.

ABR Project Director David Ngo said the RMIT process turns a waste product into a core ingredient in the next generation of cement blends.

""Climate change will not be solved by one single solution, however, the collaboration between ABR and RMIT will yield an efficient and effective technology for our net-zero goals,"" Ngo said.

The team is also investigating potential applications for the converted carbon, including in construction materials.

""Ideally the carbon we make could be turned into a value-added product, contributing to the circular economy and enabling the CCS technology to pay for itself over time,"" Daeneke said.

The solar power station, delivered by Emirati hands, demonstrates the country's commitment to providing long-term solutions to Yemen's energy crisis. Yemen has received humanitarian aid, medical assistance, and military assistance from the UAE.

The first batch of power stations has arrived at Aden's port, and more are expected to follow.

I'm strongly in favor of action to address climate change, and I do think this idea could help, but I want to offer a tempering point:  
  
When someone presumes to come at me with diet advice, or when I perceive it that way, I balk. Sometimes they just really mean it, but there are other times when they're trying save animals, but couch it as concern for the environment and for my health. Sometimes they're concerned for the environment, but couches it as concern for animáis or my health. Sometimes they're just being busybodies presuming to tell me (sometimes incorrectly at best) what is good for my health, while couching it as concern for animals or the environment. I get to the point where I want to say they should observe boundaries with me but if I allow for exploration of one or more of these areas, they should say what they mean, and not beat around the bush. If they're going for multiple benefits then say so, but be aware not everyone is going to be ok with co-mingling claimed concern with someone else's personal health with points that are in reality efforts to support advocacy points for broader societal gain. As well, nutritional advice is often wrong or does not take into account personal individualized health issues.

With that said, and sorry for my cantankerous old man routine in the face of a good idea, but  yes perhaps there is value to exploring discussions with folks as to objective reasons to question how much cured meat is consumed.  My amount has gone to nearly zero for personal health reasons, and sometimes I'm not sure about the points about reducing meat consumption in general in order to help climate change (I'm not sure of the degree of damage in ghg emissions comes from human meat consumption) but it does sound like human meat consumption does lead to some adverse ghg impact.","action","2024-03-21 12:48:49","1bio95h","melville48",0,2,0,"True","2021-05-12 19:26:03",73,379,2844,936,4232,34,"The production of meat is bad for the climate, so we ourselves can cut down on eating it and encourage others to do so as well.

I don't know much about making ""reels"" or social media type things but I feel like among some health conscious social media groups the information about carcinogenic foods could spread well to get the message out and get people to think twice about eating meat!

Curious, I love the mention of a bicycle path. 


Here’s why. 

-easy to submerge 
-low cost to make. Even velodrome level paths are probably a fraction of the cost of the average highway, or would be, if there was scale. (I mean paths you can ride as fast as if in a velodrome, not actual velodrome paths)
-ultra lightweight, compared to roads that are engineered for multiple multi-tonne vehicles. 
-easy to remove
-less materials such as different grades of rock or different layers at the level of complexity as a road requires 
-less logistics or fuel requirements to make the high speed bike roads as the volume of equipment needed is lower and far less excavation is required
-easier to move if it’s realised later that it’s in the incorrect place

I’ve some thoughts on raised bike roads. Using timber as a carbon sink.

How?

Identify land where you can grow a plantation on venice or in the water around it, perhaps mangroves or something that grows wood on brackish water 

Plant that plantation, mix it up with as much as you can plant that isn’t going to be harvested.
Wait for it to grow.
Harvest it early as you plant more.
The harvested  is machined and dried carefully, using special modern climate controlled sheds, taking as long as is needed to make a long term material. 
The timber is then wrapped with an alloy or steel alloy sheet metal. Machine wrapped and sealed. Depending on conditions, open for atmospheric breathing for the timber.

Then you have a machine drive piles and lay supports and you fix the planks to that.

If it’s in the wrong spot you remove the planks and the supports and piles using the same machine, and simply move it. 

That becomes a raised or elevated boardroad, one that can be used at high speed or ultra high speed. It may need some coating depending on the cost or complexity of wrapping the timbers, or the thickness of the sheetmetal.

It could be made to have raised walls or a roof so that an accident or dismount results in no risk or injury apart from that from other riders.

This is a very high cost elevated road, but as some sheet metals are low cost, and some trees are very fast growing, it’s possible to do trials at affordable amounts and rapidly improve the process until each road is a carbon store, assuming someone gets solar steel refineries happening without the pollution costs of coal, or something similar. It’s not trivial at the beginning, but the advantage it has is that it’s able to be moved, being a modular engineered thing on light piles, and being elevated, lets a person use it even if low flooding is occurring.

A key aspect is to be able to have a machine remove and relay planks, so that you don’t need to paint them or repair or replace them by hand if they have corrosion. However if the machine is unavailable then doing the planks by hand is a manageable thing due to the type, size and weight.

Hardwood was what I visualised, however to begin with some planted softwoods, if there’s a place to grow them, could be useful due to the lower weight of some softwoods.","action","2024-01-18 15:33:08","1999ih4","xeneks",0,2,0,"True","2016-06-06 07:52:54",279,395,460,14872,16006,7,"Venice already against climate change with a $6 billion MOSE barrier.

I don’t really feel like going into depth typing on my phone… but in short the amount of subsidies going to meat are actually not nearly as much as what goes to commodity crops (e.g corn, soy, cotton, wheat, rice). However, corn and soy are the largest receivers of subsidies and animal feed is the largest use of these crops. However, it’s not as simple as just stopping subsidizing… it’s a larger structural problem within US agriculture markets and policy that favor the overproduction of commodity crops which are used for cheap animal feed and thus indirectly “subsidize” industrial animal production. Subsidies are just one piece of the puzzle and were actually a policy response to overproduction and chronically low prices that we’re occurring before subsidies existed. Subsidies currently essentially prop up a broken system and prevent actually addressing the structural problems. Just getting rid of them would likely not solve the problem.

I wanted to respond to this comment specifically because it's extremely clear that you're in a spiral of depression and anxiety and it's causing you to believe things that simply aren't true. Even the most pessimistic scientists aren't saying there will be *literally no plants or animals* in under 10 years. You will not find a single peer-reviewed paper suggesting that. Actually, forget peer review -- no reputable climatologist would **tweet** that. It just isn't a thing.

I could say so many things to try and make you feel better, like that [we're most likely to max out at 2.7C](https://climateactiontracker.org/) even with no new actions and policies after today, or that [emissions are going to peak before 2030](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/charting-the-global-energy-landscape-to-2050-emissions) when the ""business as usual"" projections had them not peaking at all, or that [global warming will stop](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached/) once emissions reach net zero.

But that won't help you. When you're stuck in a doom spiral, there's no perfect link you can click to get out. Your rational mind is no longer in the driver's seat. That paralyzes you, preventing you from getting politically involved in vital climate action, but even worse, it makes you a danger to yourself. You start thinking things like ""Why should I live if there's no hope?"" when there are SO MANY GODDAMN REASONS TO LIVE.

Carl Jung said that ""When an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate."" Therapy is about noticing the subconscious, arresting spirals, and being aware of harmful mental habits. I am just a stranger on the internet but I am **begging** you to seek therapy. There are plenty of professionals trained specifically to help with eco-anxiety. You can meet with them virtually if you don't live near any of them. You can't simply wake up every day hoping that a chronic illness will have cured itself. You need treatment.

P.S. Something you can do right now: get the hell off any collapse-adjacent subs. Not a single person on them knows what the fuck they're talking about -- they do nothing but jerk each other off about how fucked humanity is and how smart they are for having noticed it first.

The rule from the Bureau of Land Management, an arm of the Interior Department, builds on the Biden administration’s broader strategy for tackling methane, which accounts for nearly a third of global warming. Cutting methane emissions is [one of the fastest ways to slow climate change](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/02/03/cracking-down-methane-ultra-emitters-is-quick-way-combat-climate-change-researchers-find/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4), since it traps 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide during its first 20 years in the atmosphere.

The Environmental Protection Agency [unveiled plans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/02/methane-emissions-greenhouse-gas-oil-epa/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) for preventing methane leaks from oil and gas wells at the [U.N. Climate Change Conference](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/cop28/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) in Dubai in December. [President Biden](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/candidates/joe-biden-2024/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5)’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, also requires oil and gas companies to pay the first-ever federal fee for each ton of methane they emit.

“This final rule, which updates 40-year-old regulations, furthers the Biden-Harris administration’s goals to prevent \[methane\] waste, protect our environment and ensure a fair return to American taxpayers,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.

Wednesday’s rule seeks to prevent accidental and negligent leaks of methane — the main component of natural gas — from wells, pipelines and other infrastructure. It also aims to discourage venting and flaring — the practices of intentionally releasing methane into the atmosphere, rather than building equipment to capture it.

These practices have become prevalent on public lands across the country, federal data shows. Between 2010 and 2020, companies reported venting and flaring an average of about [44.2 billion cubic feet](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-takes-action-reduce-methane-releases-public-and-tribal-lands#:~:text=Technology%20Upgrades%3A%20The%20rule%20would,on%20federal%20and%20Indian%20leases.) of gas per year — enough to meet the energy needs of roughly 675,000 homes, according to the Interior Department.

Myself and a group of my friends (biotechnologists, botanists, mathematicians, geologists, and some students of philosophy and political science), discussing climate change damage that we have begun to observe very closely in its micro-effects on the environment, decided to found a nonprofit organization to decrease CO2 levels on a large scale through a series of bottom-up approaches.

Over the past 30 years, many words have been spent. Many inconclusive actions have been taken: the time is right to take conclusive and powerful ones. But as our plan is bottom up, we need everyone's participation. We are fragile at the moment. In the birth stage. And this is where an idea becomes real: when many people believe in it and work to make it so.

Someone once said that: ""A man is great when he plants trees under which he knows he will never take shade."" It is time to be great, and it is factually time to plant.

We all know that nature is the finest scientist there is, and we have decided to base the approach on fractality, founding it on 3 different branches that will be organized and reorganized whenever necessary:

1. Planting

Trees, plants, spores: it doesn't matter what. But we have to plant. We cannot wait for technology to bring us the final solution to solve the problem. The approach will be based on hydrogeological, faunal and mathematical analyses that will be carried out territory by territory, trying to optimize fauna as much as possible in forested places and increasing the amount of plants and spores that decrease CO2 and microparticulate. Every micro-action will be fundamental to compound effect-none of this will be planned top down. It is clear now that government organizations and industries carry out more greenwashing and rhetoric than action on land: we will carry out action on land only. No words: the time for rhetoric is ending. We will not ask anyone for a rescue plan: only permits, when necessary, to plant. Nothing more than that.

2. Ethical behavior

Numerous analyses have shown that about 50 percent of arable land is occupied by animal farms. We know from so many examples over the past 30 years that calling for their closure is utopian, but apparently it is not very much in vogue that the market responds to demand: as demand decreases, they will have to reinvent themselves. An ideal ethical behavior would be to reduce meat consumption by 50 percent. One is not asking to become vegan or vegetarian, only to increase plant-based consumption. And if one asks: then those lands will be used for industrial agriculture, the answer is no: the lands suitable for planting animal food, which exceed 60 percent of global crops, would be used.

And this is just one example of ethical behavior to be implemented: we will add more in the manifesto we will publish soon.

3. Collaborations for technological developments.

As we act, we plan. And we plan how to optimize with the wonderful technology we have available devices that can absorb and transform as much co2 as possible. We know how difficult it is to plant trees and how cancerous the air is in cities-this would be an ideal solution, at the moment only idealistic. For now.

We have opened a newsletter, where we will publish studies and various projects and keep a transparent bureaucracy across the board. It will be hard and tiring work, full of no's and full of frustration. We ask for your support so that the environment does not collapse on us, so that we can still enjoy this wonder called planet Earth. There is still time, but not for long. Now is the time to be great: help us.

If you want to participate and stand with us, fight with us and make an impact, we accept anyone with good will. If you are in the biological, ethological, geological, water and biotechnological fields even better. If you are in the political field, participate in similar organizations or otherwise know anyone who might care, you are welcome.

We currently act in central and southern Europe, and aim to have collaborators all over the world. Any help is welcome.

&gt;Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has just over a month to choose the city’s next clean-energy leader.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the L.A. Department of Water and Power’s current general manager, Marty Adams, set to retire March 1, Bass is mulling her options. And a coalition of climate advocacy and environmental justice groups want to know who those options are.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a letter addressed to Bass, 15 groups — including the California Environmental Justice Alliance, Heal the Bay and the Sierra Club — are urging the city to “publicly release a list of its top candidates, the metrics by which they were chosen, and ultimately the factors that were considered in choosing the future nominated general manager.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“For the sake of transparency and public accountability, we ask that this process be open and fair,” the groups wrote.  
&gt;  
&gt;The DWP’s next general manager will play a huge role in determining whether Los Angeles achieves its goal of 100% climate-friendly energy by 2035 — an ambitious target set by the previous mayor, Eric Garcetti. Bass’ office told me last month that she continues to support the 2035 goal, even as climate has been less of a public focus for her than it was for her predecessor.  
&gt;  
&gt;The water and power agency’s next leader will probably face competing demands from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 18, the union that represents thousands of DWP workers. IBEW members staff the DWP’s gas-fired power plants and have fought to keep them open, even as they add to the climate crisis and pollute the air in surrounding neighborhoods.","science","2024-01-30 16:42:26","1aessjc","Sammy_Roth",0,1,0,"True","2014-11-20 22:25:56",222,0,22084,1950,24256,2,"","Column: Karen Bass faces a big climate test as she chooses the DWP's next leader",0.63,2,0,"2024-01-30 16:42:11"

We aren't maintaining some utopia by not enacting draconian climate policies. Life for the majority of the 8 billion on this planet is already oppressed and restricted.

Why do those few, leaders living in luxury, the rich throwing wealth around, ineffectual weak-willed legislators and lawless judicial arbiters, deserve protection against having their lives affected along with everyone else?

This is why the COP conferences are held in luxurious settings with sterile PowerPoint slides and careful talks, to not upset those in the best position to enact change. Look at the rest of us, the billions of us who don't attend. We are allowing them to ignore the reality of **our** peril. Why? We're afraid. Afraid of security, afraid of being arrested, of being labeled or beaten up for daring approach the Great and Mighty Leaders. Because of our fears, the COP attendees remain safely insulated from the reality beyond their fancy venues, the empty talk, and the photo ops they take home to their respective countries.

Standing up and spitting truth at these useless people is not what we should be afraid of now. What we **should** be afraid of is how damn fast maintaining the *status quo for them* is allowing the lives of the rest of the masses to increasingly disintegrate under not just climate effects, but under the austerities being forced upon us anyway.","science","2024-01-10 15:48:39","192f3y9","BadAsBroccoli",0,2,0,"True","2020-09-12 18:16:31",1365,532,30,139346,141273,31,"","Record opposition to climate action by UK’s right-leaning newspapers in 2023",1,31,0,"2024-01-09 13:48:42"

Although the theoretical limit of the human body to tolerate heat and humidity is a wet bulb temperature of 35 C (with 100% humidity), practical empirical studies show that the limit for healthy, young, individuals is more like 30.6 C (with 100% humidity). Thus, our human body is nowhere near as resilient to heat and humidity as we previously thought. 

Also, very bad is the fact that the elderly, the very young, people on medications like antidepressants, the obese, those with medical conditions, and people exercising outside, and exposed to sunlight, are much less resilient than those healthy, young individuals in the study, so the heat and humidity combination for them to collapse is even lower than 30.6 C with 100% humidity. 

Not good.

The new study that I chat about is:
“Greatly enhanced risk to humans as a consequence ofempirically determined lower moist heat stress tolerance”
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2305427120

Basically, this study used the empirical body resilience wet bulb numbers to see which regions of the planet will become uninhabitable first. 

Climate models project warming and humidity conditions into the future for various warming levels, and show that billions of people will soon be exposed to temperature-humidity conditions not conducive to survival outside. They will have to stay indoors with air conditioning, unless they burrow underground or wear spacesuit like chill suits to be outside for any length of time.

Today, countries are still far from meeting these much-hyped promises, even as the impacts of climate change intensify across the globe. Deforestation remains rampant, pushing the Amazon rainforest toward a [tipping point](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2022/amazon-brazil-tipping-point/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4). Levels of methane in the atmosphere continue to climb to new records.

Some climate advocates have grown weary of the seemingly endless stream of splashy announcements at the annual U.N. climate confabs. They’re pushing negotiators at the next summit, which will be held in Dubai this month, to back up their pledges with concrete actions — or risk undermining the legitimacy of the talks.

“There is a bit of a pledging fatigue,” said Carlos Lopes, who chairs the board of the African Climate Foundation, a grant-making organization based in Cape Town, South Africa. “We go into these meetings, and there is another pledge and then another pledge. And people are actually not fulfilling their commitments.”

At the summit in Glasgow in 2021, more than 140 countries, representing over 85 percent of the world’s forests, vowed to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Signatories of the declaration included large forest nations such as Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But other rainforest countries, such as Bolivia and Venezuela, have not yet joined.

The declaration recognized that trees play a critical role in combating climate change by storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide in their trunks, branches and roots. When trees are cut down or burn in a wildfire, they release this carbon back into the atmosphere.

These are crucial, no doubt, but sometimes the enormity of it all can feel overwhelming. What if we introduced something simpler, something universal?

Imagine taking a single deep breath, but not alone—in concert with another person, a group, a community, or even the entire planet. How powerful would it be to share this basic human act as a synchronized effort, across continents, religions, and cultures?

I propose that we set aside moments in our day to take a collective, intentional deep breath. Let's call it ""Breathing for Humanity."" By doing this, we do more than pause; we create a global cadence, a heartbeat that sends a message of unity and purpose. And perhaps, just perhaps, this collective act could serve to steady humanity's ""nervous system,"" offering a shared respite from the frenzied pace that often leads to reckless decisions affecting our climate.

We're all here because we care deeply about the Earth. And Earth, fundamentally, is what allows us to breathe. So why not give a moment back? A moment of gratitude, of unity, and of shared purpose?

The logistics are simple. We collectively decide on a specific time (or times) of the day and then, wherever we are, we take a slow, deep breath. And if you're outdoors or in a public space, take a moment to acknowledge others you see participating.

What do you think?

I'm also aware that such wavelengths are rare in solar spectrum but what if we use non-linear optics to get those?

\- Are not illegal (in USA)

\- Target corporations and do not hurt individuals

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus points for hurting corporate profits and gaining attention. Some ideas I've had are:

\- stand outside a car dealership with a large sign, urging folks not to buy new gas-powered vehicles. The goal is to hurt sales and shame drivers out of choosing the more-harmful option when they need a vehicle

\- Go to car dealerships and test-drive all the cars, thereby consuming the dealerships time and resources. Do not purchase a vehicle. This one also makes the dealerships wary of actual legitimate customers over time, which will hurt their sales because they will be standoffish and rude

\- Go to a gas station with a sign saying ""gas is cheaper at &lt;gas station down the road&gt;"". This hurts the gas station bottom line and causes a ""race to the bottom"" where fossil fuels become less profitable as gas stations lower their prices 

\- Mail heavy or cumbersome trash to corporate HQ for fossil fuel companies

\- Stand outside fossil fuel HQ filming whoever walks in or out. Ask them questions about why they do what they do. Put pressure on them to quit their job. Shame them for their job. Filming in public is legal, but this one it will be important to adhere to privacy rules if the people express that they do not wish to be filmed or the company does the same.

On a related note, I'm also making low-cost weather stations for smallholder farmers in Africa. Here again, it would be great to include WBGT as it seems to be superior in capturing more factors related to heat stress. But it's harder to measure and requires more maintenance than other sensors.

Also, I chatted with James Hansen in a one-on-one video discussion recorded on the Climate Emergency Forum (CEF):
Video on website:
https://climateemergencyforum.org/

Aerosols in the atmosphere have a direct cooling effect, since they block some of the incoming sunlight and thus have a cooling effect on the surface of the planet. 

However, the much larger cooling effect is from the Aerosol Indirect Forcing effect. Over the oceans, there are very few particles in the pristine air to act as cloud condensation nuclei. Aerosols created from the sulphur contained within the burning of marine shipping fuels are well known to affect low level marine clouds. This new paper examines these polluted air clouds and compares their features to those of nearby natural low level marine clouds. 

Cloud properties of importance are the size of the water droplets, the liquid water path (amount of water through the cloud) and cloud coverage fraction (area). The Twomey effect essentially means that with more aerosols, there are a lot more cloud condensation nuclei, so there are a lot more water droplets in the cloud and these droplets are much smaller. Thus, the cloud reflectivity is much higher, and the cloud lifetime is much longer, and also the cloud coverage area is much larger, so the aerosol cooling effect is much greater. 

According to Hansen, the marine aerosols peaked years ago and caused a radiative cooling as high as -2 to -3 W/m2. In 2015 the International Maritime Organization legislated sulphur reduction in the commercial shipping fuels, and in 2020 tightened these regulations even more. This greatly reduced the marine aerosols and this new paper measured the recent radiative cooling effect to be -1.1 W/m2. 

This measurement thus corroborates what Hansen is saying about our Faustian Bargain, and would explain why global warming has accelerated from 0.18C per decade prior to 2010 to between 0.27C and 0.36C since 2010, and even accelerated significantly since 2020.

A very important paper on the atmospheric physics of aerosols and global dimming.

I've heard that the issue is scaling it and making it commercially viable. Fair enough. But what I'm wondering is, do we have plastic-digesting organisms which can handle plastic sufficiently that small groups could set up their own non-commercial plastic-digesting systems? Would it be viable to get some fermenting equipment, get access to bacteria which digest plastic, and set up neighborhood plastic-disposal tanks maintained on a small scale? What would the obstacles for that be, and could they be surmounted? Basically, are we at the point where this is doable, or is it a total dead end for the foreseeable future?

I know full well that it's way more important to reduce the amount of plastic waste generated in the first place, but there's enough already in existence that this feels worthwhile. I also feel like seeing the amount of work that goes in to breaking down plastic on a local level might help people to rethink unnecessary plastic usage, because it would be very ""in your face"" about it.

It's for this exact reason, and the suspicion I have that there are more out there like me, that I'd like to share my perspective on ways to fight the problem. 

Focus on the economic side. I know it sounds insane at a first glance, but think about it.
If doing things that helped the global climate and biodiversity were more profitable than not, what would stop people from doing those things? Even climate change deniers? 

If, say, electric cars were more efficient, affordable, and convenient than gas powered, the average consumer wouldn't buy them because they don't produce trace carbon emissions- they'd buy them because it would be the best decision economically! Similarly, if we focus on getting energy production and storage to the point where the clean was undeniably more profitable than the dirty, fossil fuel companies would have to either jump ship or sink. 

So that's my idea and message. If you want to focus on getting corporations and governments to take accountability for the damage they're doing, that's fine, but I don't believe it will do as much good as we need done. I say we should focus on near non-stop innovation of renewable energies and storage, as well as getting the science more precise and doing what we can to protect biodiversity in our planet's ecosystems. Improve batteries, improve solar cell efficiency, improve education on the importance of these issues, whether you're a teacher or a parent or just a person with a device on the Internet trying to find ways to make a difference. It's a really, really steep road ahead, but I think with a little ingenuity we can definitely make a difference. 

Don't lose hope because governments are corrupt and corporations are powerful. That isn't going to change. But the wheels they run on can be changed. I hope anyone reading this understands what I'm getting at. If you do and appreciate the message, do all you can to spread it to others, in my words or your own. We can absolutely fight this. We just need to shift our perspective a little, roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty.","A potentially helpful perspective on fighting climate change",0.87,23,0,"2023-10-06 16:27:00"

Eating local isn't a silver bullet either. Transportation is a tiny fraction of total emissions from food production. There is no reason that many small farms taking up more overall area is better than a few large ones.

Have your say on [Australia's new nature positive laws](https://consult.dcceew.gov.au/australias-new-nature-positive-laws).

Key aspects of the failings of this legislation.

1. The Act only focuses on Domestic emissions and not the emissions from burning exported fossil fuels.
2. There is no climate trigger, only a safeguard mechanism activated by exceeding a limit on domestic emissions for a single project. A massive loophole you can drive a gas tanker through.
3. Self-assessment and reporting is the primary mechanism for the legal process to be activated.
4. No consideration of climate change impacts on biodiversity habitat shifts.
5. No retroactive enforcement on existing mining leases and their environmental rehabilitation.
6. Very limited definitions of ""unacceptable impacts"".
7. The minister for environment may override  (call in?) the ostensibly independent EPA assessments of any project in the National Interest. A mechanism that has failed the community in many other government bodies.

Aussie citizens. Please comment on this legislation. It may help but the fix may already be in if my experience in the first webinar on the matter is any experience.

The idea is to print ""CO2 receipts"" that mimic shopping receipts but instead of recording cost, records carbon footprint. Specifically, I plan on hanging around near various gas stations, and when someone fills up their car's tank and leaves to pay, I calculate (roughly) how much CO2 would be produced by the amount of gas they bought, print a CO2 receipt and place it on the car's windshield. I'm still workshopping what the receipt will say but something along the lines of:

Thank you for your purchase of

**XX.X tonnes of CO2**

*\[Time and date\]*

We hope its worth it.

Maybe consider catching the bus next time.

\[website or social media link\]

Now obviously this isn't comparable to organised protests, lobbying, radical action or divestment, but maybe it'll get some news coverage and/or start a bit of a movement.

At the end of the day, it will at least get some people thinking about climate change and hopefully reduce transport emissions a little.

Your family's survival is in jeopardy. The climate emergency is that bad. Don't let big oil and gas eke out a few more years of profit at the expense of your survival. 

A few words about the recent climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act. 

Our government is in thrall to Big Oil and Big Gas - one need look no further to confirm this than the Inflation Reduction Act (""IRA""). After years of doing absolutely nothing about the climate emergency even as we all watched the world burn and rivers dry up, Congress passed the IRA. Now Congress struts like a drunk that managed to get it together for a day even while going back to their petrodollar addiction. 

What's required for human survival, according to sources like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is a transition greater than any other in 200,000 years (!!) of human history. What do you see around you that even faintly looks like such a transition? Certainly not the IRA: it's way, too little - $37 billion each year for 10 years. 

It's not just that the IRA is too little, it's also that the IRA is a manifestation of big oil/gas' stranglehold over our government. The personification of corruption, Joe Manchin, managed to get his petrodollar fix by slipping some really bad stuff in. He shafted all of us, but especially Indigenous folks, by streamlining the approval process for the dirty Mountain Valley Pipeline, which will juice the profits of a few gas tycoons at the expense of our survival.

Ask yourself: are you willing to risk your survival on the whims of grifters like Joe Manchin without a (non-violent) fight?

Also- Forest fires release an enormous amount of Particulate Matter/black carbon which land on top of glaciers - speeding their melt, and feeding nutrients to pink algae which also melts glaciers faster. 

And Forest fires are only slated to keep increasing in size and intensity.

We got the ball rolling, feedback is already in play. 

What could be super interesting is if a superbug escapes the glaciers that is extremely good at fixing carbon and previously existed back when the carbon dioxide levels are as high as they are now - so they are already adapted to the kind of atmosphere we are making.

I'm not in anyway trying to say Global Warming isn't real.

I'm not in anyway trying to suggest the greenhouse effect isn't real (although Orlov seems to)

My point is about Kerry implying Russia doesn't want to deal with Climate Change.  Kerry has his agenda.  Whether the oceans are heating because of humans or because of ""something else"" is not my wicket.  The point was to provide an alternate suggestion from Orlov and his point that the whole Solar System is heating up for some reason.  Why is the core of the planets in the Solar System heating up?  Orlov says it isn't ""well understood"".

I agree with Orlov when he says CO2 on earth isn't warming the core of Mars.

"269513","kectcyv",1,"Hey all, hope you'll read my latest L.A. Times column and let me know what you think. Here's how it starts:

&gt;Few people have a more important role to play in confronting the climate crisis than the head of the L.A. Department of Water and Power.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although DWP is best known for its history of shady water grabs — as memorialized in the film “Chinatown” — it’s also a hugely influential player in the energy world. The agency drew international attention when it concluded it would be able to power the nation’s second-largest city with 100% climate-friendly electricity by 2035. Its early investments in large-scale solar power, green hydrogen and other clean energy technologies presaged similar moves by power companies across the country.  
&gt;  
&gt;So if you care about limiting the deadly heat waves, destructive wildfires and other harms of global warming, you should care that Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is looking for a new general manager for DWP.  
&gt;  
&gt;Marty Adams, the current head honcho, announced over the summer that he would retire in early February. His successor will lead DWP through a crucial period in the clean energy transition, during which the city will hopefully show the world it’s possible to dramatically reduce our use of planet-warming fossil fuels — without prompting widespread blackouts or causing electricity prices to soar out of control.  
&gt;  
&gt;But some climate advocates are concerned that the Bass administration has done little to solicit public input on the next general manager. They’re also worried that DWP may not be as committed to 100% clean energy by 2035 as it once was.

I lived in California and the coastal area was vastly different in climate from what you found inland even as little as 10 miles. This was not always 'warmer' and more pleasant. It could be unpleasantly cold in San Francisco and on the same day be too hot even 10 miles inland. San Diego was general pleasant year round where inland 60 miles could be hellishly hot or cold. Spain is the same. When you go inland the temperature can be much hotter or colder. Of course mountains impact climate in both countries.

Recent climate reports have shown alarming trends as 2023 was confirmed as the hottest year on record and rising temperatures led to the loss of 1 million square kilometers of arctic ice in the last year. 

As the Biden administration is committing nearly $4 billion toward jumpstarting a new carbon capture industry in the U.S., CBS News was given an inside look at two companies taking different approaches to process.

Graphyte is a startup that takes leftover material from timber and rice mills and turns it into bricks to be wrapped up and buried in the ground — for now, in a field in central Arkansas.

""We're taking the carbon captured by plants and keeping it out of the atmosphere for a thousand years or more,"" said Graphyte CEO Barclay Rogers.

Graphyte plans to turn an empty warehouse into the world's largest carbon removal facility, eventually removing 50,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year — about the equivalent of taking 10,000 cars off the road. American Airlines is currently paying Graphyte to offset some of the pollution from its flights.

"434358","jib267p",1,"I would *personally* be fine giving up  sports spectating (and concerts for that matter). I do it a few times a year, but it’s not so much something I feel like I have to do.

However, I do really enjoy going to theme parks, including traveling to do so. That’s not something I’d be willing to give up, as it’s become my main hobby over the last two years. Theme parks have similar issues with food waste, power use, land use, large parking lots, relative lack of transit access (except maybe Universal Studios Hollywood located directly above a subway station), etc. to large sports events. It’s not an apples to apples comparison, but it would sort of be hypocritical for me to say that sports events should be banned and then proceed to go to a theme park on a weekly basis.

So I’d say let people enjoy what they want to, and venues like sports events and amusement parks should take steps to becoming more sustainable. For example, reducing/eliminating fireworks shows, having more plant based food options, having eco friendly packaging, installing solar panels on large “show buildings” (where indoor theme park rides/shows are housed) or stadium roofs, installing wastewater collection systems, using relatively empty parking lots as park &amp; ride shuttle locations around the city so people don’t drive all the way to the event (a major concert venue in my city does this and it’s 100x better than their expensive and traffic-jammed parking on site), etc.","action","2023-04-30 14:10:47","132tv3f","LankyEmergency7992",0,1,0,"True","2020-08-03 20:44:39",3167,13769,10971,14291,42198,16,"This link is just one example of what these sports are doing: https://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/infographic/whats-footballs-carbon-footprint/

Subject: Drop your fossil fuel powered appliances!

    Dear Best Buy Investor Relations,
    
    I'm pleased to see that you have a goal to help your customers reduce their environmental impact and that you are already a leader in the EPAs Green Power Partnership to use more Green Energy.
    
    I'd like to ask you to take the next step, drop the fossil fuel powered appliances (gas ranges, grills, and dryers) and add new Insignia electric options (Insignia Induction Range). I understand that you have 100s of products that fall into this category and removing them all overnight will likely not be feasible. There are many reasons to start acting today:
    
     * Climate Change means we need to stop using fossil fuels - the sooner the better.
     * The war in Ukraine is partially funded by high methane gas prices.
     * Methane gas stoves are particularly bad for indoor air quality.
     * The US IRA bill funds electrification - Best Buy should endeavor to be *the* electrification retailer.
    
    This is a great opportunity to lead and get sustainability investors like me.
    
    Please take as much action as you can. Thank you!

People could also share an ask via social networking to Best Buy, just something like ""Please lead on dropping fossil fuel powered appliances.  Stand with the climate, Ukraine and indoor air quality""

The reason I choose Best Buy is because they are a major appliance seller - but do not have lawn care products so less to remove.  Here is their current status of what they sell:

All (In Stock)

* Ranges - Electrical - 126 (114), Gas 150 (125), Dual fuel 61 (46). Induction (inc in E) is 17/18.
* Dryer - Electric 432 (144), Gas 384 (115)
* Cooktop - Electric - 258 (220), Gas 312 (265), Propane 34, Induction (inc in E) 106 (90)

&gt;Forecasting the risks of climate change for species and ecosystems is necessary for developing targeted conservation strategies. Previous risk assessments mapped the exposure of the global land surface to changes in climate. However, this procedure is unlikely to robustly identify priority areas for conservation actions because nonlinear physiological responses and colimitation processes ensure that ecological changes will not map perfectly to the forecast climatic changes. Here, we combine ecophysiological growth models of 135,153 vascular plant species and plant growth-form information to transform ambient and future climatologies into phytoclimates, which describe the ability of climates to support the plant growth forms that characterize terrestrial ecosystems. We forecast that 33% to 68% of the global land surface will experience a significant change in phytoclimate by 2070 under representative concentration pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Phytoclimates without present-day analogue are forecast to emerge on 0.3–2.2% of the land surface and 0.1–1.3% of currently realized phytoclimates are forecast to disappear. Notably, the geographic pattern of change, disappearance and novelty of phytoclimates differs markedly from the pattern of analogous trends in climates detected by previous studies, thereby defining new priorities for conservation actions and highlighting the limits of using untransformed climate change exposure indices in ecological risk assessments. Our findings suggest that a profound transformation of the biosphere is underway and emphasize the need for a timely adaptation of biodiversity management practices.","science","2024-02-28 07:02:59","1b1ztoy","[deleted]",0,2,0,"False","",0,0,0,0,0,3,"","Reassessment of the risks of climate change for terrestrial ecosystems",0.72,3,0,"2024-02-28 07:02:11"

This is what happens when you prioritize gleaming skyscrapers and pharaonic projects over anything else. Beneath the glittering façade lies a cityscape marred by shortsighted urban design and misplaced priorities.

One of the most glaring flaws in Dubai's urban planning is its disregard for the natural environment. Built amidst desert sands, the city's relentless expansion has led to the destruction of precious ecosystems and exacerbation of heat island effects. Instead of integrating sustainable practices like green spaces and efficient water management, Dubai's development favors concrete jungles, mega malls, inmmense parking lots and 12-lane highways over ecological harmony.

Furthermore, the city's obsession with pharaonic projects comes at the expense of practicality and functionality. In a region susceptible to extreme weather events, including this week's record rainfall, Dubai's infrastructure proves woefully inadequate.

Allegiant has a 25-year contract to buy electricity from a new solar farm in the desert not far from Vegas, just up Interstate 15.

&gt;“People sometimes get nervous about renewable power, because they’re not sure if it’s going to be reliable.

Greetings relatives and allies, please review and sign the urgent petition below to prevent a genocide in Brazil. This petition was started by Yorenka Tasorentsi Institute under the guidance of Benki Piyãko, spiritual and political leader of the Ashaninká people of the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon with an extremely important message from Nobel Peace Prize nominee Chief Raoni Metuktire of the Kayapo people of Brazil. Tomorrow the Brazilian Federal Congress will vote on Marco Temporal Bill 490/2007, this bill is an attempt to remove indigenous land rights in Brazil which would be a death sentence to the indigenous peoples of Brazil and constitute a deliberate attack to the territorial, physical, and cultural integrity of the original peoples of Brazil.

Oil companies position weakens every time someone connects them to a flood, a heatwave, or a supercharged storm. Every attack matters. Every twitch on the dial of public opinion matters. Every drop in share price on the stock market matters. When people lose confidence in a business, that business loses money. How do we accelerate the loss of confidence? [Overwhelming negative publicity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateOffensive/comments/15wcd8v/oil_companies_are_afraid_of_overwhelming_negative/)

They have burned children's futures to line their pockets, and still they receive handouts of government money, taxpayer money.  [$7 trillion of it last year](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/24/fossil-fuel-subsidies-surged-to-record-7-trillion), the most ever. **Well I say we make 2023 the year they receive the most negative publicity ever too.**

Reddit, Twitter, Tiktok. None are perfect, but all can work if you know how to use them.

Anyone too scared to attack under their own name, use Alt accounts, [VPNs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwju3OeZp-aBAxUP4QIHHWNBCyQQFnoECAYQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrowsec.com%2Fen%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2w6cOHBroQmmwgNyJp5NdA&amp;opi=89978449),  or put ""Allegedly"" before your attacks - ""Allegedly, ExxonMobil are responsible for the deaths of millions thanks to their disgusting lies and profiteering.""

Or frame attack as a question (Tucker Carlson style) - ""Do Shell want to profit from mass flooding, or do they just not care?""

I doubt any oil company would take any of us to court as it would give them negative publicity and that's what they are most scared of, but in case anyone is paranoid, use the above.

I created an Alt twitter account to [attack oil companies](https://twitter.com/FrankKane80/status/1708055662817652878) and anyone who helps them. I don't care how many people see, I will keep going. Every week more. If they respond, even better. More negative publicity for them.

A short, relevant message from George Orwell:

""We believe half-instinctively that evil always defeats itself in the long run. We have become too civilized to grasp the obvious...to survive you often have to fight, and to fight you have to dirty yourself. War is evil, and it is often the lesser evil."" - Orwell.

It's time to dirty ourselves r/climateoffensive. There is no cause more worthy. Every attack that is seen by at least one person spreads the message a bit further. If we all use the same attack line, even 1000 of the 60,000+ of us in this sub, the algorithms will pick it up, amplifying it further. I will post the attack ideas this sub came up with previously below. Post more attack ideas \[in square brackets\] just like last time.

I list a few:

&amp;#x200B;

1 Surveillance:

The app (which is provided at COP27 for shuttle bus schedules or to find hospitals) is obviously not created to be trusted. Attendees at the next conference should consider taking a second smartphone with them to prevent it from being infiltrated by malware or have only one person in a group install the app on a second smartphone and thus obtain relevant information for the group and then distribute it to the group by word of mouth.

Article:[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/06/egypt-cop27-climate-surveillance-cybersecurity](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/06/egypt-cop27-climate-surveillance-cybersecurity)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2 CO2 footprint of all flights of delegates and VIP participants:

European politicians as a group or e.g. american continent residents as a group should seriously consider sensible planning of ride-along opportunities before they all fly in parallel in separate private jets or government aircrafts to COP28. There is no reason for a delegation from France and one from Germany to fly separately when they can all fit on a larger plane that can be just as well shielded from non-participants in this ""VIP delegation"". Even if the length of stay of individual group members varies: Then just take a regular commercial flight if you don't stay for the whole timeframe or if you have to return earlier or later!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3 fenced activism and activist's security

In the pre-event (for Cop27 this took place in Bonn in June 2022:[https://unfccc.int/SB56](https://unfccc.int/SB56) ), governments should make it mandatory for the host country to not only allow climate activists to hold demonstrations in a fenced area OR even make that a prerequisite in future COP countries. Demonstrations, talks with journalists and exchanges with domestic activists should also be allowed outside the area. Not in the form of Potemkin villages, but real, free meetings - without surveillance babysitters. Paying lip service to alleged improvement in the host country (as just happened with Qatar hosting the World Cup) lacks credibility and are detrimental to humanity's climate goals. *Activists who are most vulnerable in the host country should be able to join all sessions via videoconference. Activist groups of several countries should put each other on a* ***crisis control list*** *that is active for the course of the conference and ideally for the months afterward, so that donor countries can intervene if necessary with political pressure to release political prisoners..*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4 Training for participants

Due to the incidents with the app in Egypt (at COP27) and the communication via open WLANs in hotel environments, all participants, not only NGOs, should consider encryption of their communication and securing their end devices. The necessary training should be provided by the UN in advance for free via the Internet so that activists do not become prisoners in their country or the host country after a conference. Also so that no devices of politicians are infiltrated (Spyware etc.)

Kind of this training:[https://www.reporter-ohne-grenzen.de/en/assistance/digital-security-lab](https://www.reporter-ohne-grenzen.de/en/assistance/digital-security-lab)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

5 Excluding or labeling the lobby at future climate conferences:

Lobby groups of climate deniers should be excluded or branded with badge color of their participant's badge. That could be done by allowig one of these 3 organizations to scan the participant's list:

[https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/fossil-gas/636-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-granted-access-cop27/](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/fossil-gas/636-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-granted-access-cop27/)

&amp;#x200B;

6 A pavilion of ""unheard questions and wishes"".

&amp;#x200B;

Several groups complained of not being heard enough because the declaration, which is negotiated for two weeks in terms of content, must be agreed upon as consensus at the beginning of the COP as well as the final declaration.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if there is always someone who has a veto, the issues that may lead to the biggest future hurdles facing the global community are not addressed (example: Water distribution struggles leading to a very large increase in migration).

&amp;#x200B;

The pavilion should simply be a kind of wailing wall where you can put your question or wishes written down. It may be possible to find delegation members who will read something and incorporate it into their work, slightly adjust a course or consider the unheard, make you heard. These questions or requests can be pinned on a wall anonymously or if response is desired with name and contact information.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

\-Points that did not make it into the consensus statements but are important to smaller delegations, individual delegations, or even individual activists.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Points that were not addressed by conferees for fear of repression at home. (Activists or delegation participants fearing political persecution).

&amp;#x200B;

\- Questions or statements that were lost among supposedly larger issues.

&amp;#x200B;

After the conclusion of the COP, the questions and requests should not simply be filed away and thrown away. On the contrary, they should be included in a separate final documentation that can be viewed by anyone worldwide on the website. Ideally next to the download documents about the final declaration. The world may calmly see what is still unresolved, unheard.

&amp;#x200B;

In more far-reaching versions, the pavilion questions and wishes could even be transferred into UN-Open Innovation Forums online to give problem solvers worldwide, even outside the climate movement, the opportunity to come forward with their ideas and inventions to help.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing here: The pavillon must be operated independently of the COP-hosting-country. The hosting country must not have the ability to restrict, prevent oder monitor the pavilion activities (as shown by the incidents at COP27 in Egypt when filming and monitoring activists).

I came across a YouTuber talking about hope. She started out by saying that she reads every scientific paper that comes out, she often finds it very depressing and feels like she's losing hope. But, she made the important point that the only reason, particularly as a woman, that she's a) capable of reading in the first place, b) is allowed to access this research and c) has the intelligence to comprehend the information contained within, is because amazing people who existed many generations before she did fought for her right to do those things, even though they knew that they'd never live long enough to meet the people who reaped the benefits.

She went on to say how unbelievably insulting would it be to all those people, who fought for us to have something of a reasonable quality of life today, for her to now sit back and say, 'You know what, I give up, I don't think we can win this one'?

I saw this when I was in a particularly low place and feeling like we were doomed, and it completely turned my attitude around. It reminded me that we don't know what we're capable of until after we've achieved it. That horrible scary feeling, that we've got no chance of being successful, has been felt by so many people in the past, at all sorts of periods throughout history. Everyone who ever achieved something amazing probably had their dark days as well, when they wondered if the fight was worth it. But it was worth it, and it's worth it now as well.

Another important perspective that I saw was from a climate scientist, who said that they find doomers more harmful than denialists these days. Firstly because a lot of what they say isn't even necessarily true from a scientific perspective, but more importantly, on a psychological level, the idea that it's all useless, creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. I agree with this. I can at least understand where deniers are coming from - I think deep down they do know, but they're as frightened as us, and their way of dealing with the problem is pretending it isn't happening. But doomers are not trying to achieve anything - all they're doing is obstructing our ability to find ways of dealing with the situation. If you truly believe that there's nothing to be done, please have the decency to sit quietly, rather than trying to influence others. Because even if in time it turns out that I'm wrong and the doomers are right and we're already WAY beyond the point of no return (I'm not a scientist, but having read as many scientific perspectives as I can I don't believe it's the case) it is STILL better to fight for all it's worth than to throw in the towel. In a worst-case scenario, I don't want to be stuck wondering what might have been if we'd got our act together quicker.

4. Don't call people stupid or dumb, but do point out if there is a lack of understanding on the subject.
5. Please proofread and spell-check your replies.
6. Do call out if the politician in question has stock or vested interest in mining, minerals and fossil energies to help bolster argument.
7. You likely won't get people to change the minds of people you debate. Please don't take this to heart. But a well-conducted conversation will be there for all to see should they come to the comment section of a video. You might just change that future watcher/reader.

You can also start a thread to break down the video itself.

There are many others.

I can't reiterate the rules enough. If you are to go in expect some horrible people. DO NOT ENGAGE THESE PEOPLE IN KIND.  Either don't respond or clarify that their response has 0 merits and that you are there for conversation.

The aim is to get people to think, to stop listening to ""simpleton science"" propagated by these politicians who either use poor science themselves or simple slogans eg: ""They aren't renewables, they are unreliables"" etc.

There are 2 ever-present takes when it comes to anything involving sustainability. 1) *""Why are we worrying about (specific, achievable thing) when (larger, more intractable thing) is the real culprit?""* and 2) *""Why are we blaming the average joe when it's (the corporations/the government) that really got us into this mess?""*

For 1), the reality is that to have any hope of progress requires us to push for everything, at once, ASAP. We can solve some plastics pollution issues **now** that may seem minor to some people (e.g. single-use straws, plastic bags) *while* we work on ""bigger"" issues that will take years or decades (e.g. fishing nets, tire dust). Only prioritizing ""the big ones"" is an incredible gamble that only guarantees not much gets done at all. This topic is relevant because it seemed that clamping down on SUVs isn't ""big enough"" for the commenter I responded to.

For 2), it's definitely appropriate to place blame on systemic actors like corporations, lobbies, etc., but not appropriate to place *all* blame. Individual human beings have agency, even when it seems like we don't. If I take a reusable water bottle to the gym instead of buying a disposable one, that's 1 less unit of demand for a disposable water bottle, an infinitesimal impact. If a million people skip the disposable, we're talking about notable/measurable impact; doesn't matter what other weird effects are at play (induced demand, warehoused product, etc.) the facts on the ground are that demand for disposable water bottles was reduced by 1 million units. There is ALWAYS a choice even when it feels futile. So while it's true that CAFE was a disaster and manufacturers kept pumping out big stuff, it's equally true that small cars never ""went away"" and drivers were free to buy a Mazda 3 any time; they CHOSE F150s for reasons unrelated to availability.

I didn’t realize how bad things had gotten and that at this point we don’t have the tech needed to mitigate climate change. 

I’ve already set up recurring donations to several nonprofits for myself, but I think I can do a little more. 

I own a small accounting firm with about 700 clients. Preaching to them about changing their lifestyle realistically will just lose me business and not result in any change. Instead, I’m wanting to solicit donations from them, offering as low as $1 and up to whatever the client decides. I don’t feel it will amount to too much, but I have to try. If that fails, I’ll just eat the taxes and donate a portion of their invoice. 

There is just an incredible amount of information out there, so I’m hoping this sub can help me find a consensus on the best nonprofits to donate to in a couple of categories that I feel will have the greatest impact. 

I’m looking at:

-reforestation initiatives (i’m leaning toward eden project) 

-green energy development. I feel that nuclear is probably our best “bang for our buck” for keeping modern standards with less pollution. And a higher performing energy grid is necessary for EV’s to actually work. 

-carbon removal technology to clean the atmosphere 

-ocean initiatives, i’ve seen fertilization, growing certain ocean plants, and other plans but I have no idea which will provide the largest impact per dollar. 


With some luck, if this is well received, I can convince other professional firms in my area to pick this up as well. I feel like on top of trying to reduce my own carbon footprint that throwing money at those better equipped than I to help the environment is the best thing I can do.

Tallamy suggests in his book _Nature's Best Hope_ that we need to build something he calls Home Grown National Park to combat climate change and ecosystem collapse. He makes the case that biodiversity scales (over time) with connected land availability, and that we have taken most of the land for our own uses already. If everyone were to replace their grass lawn with native plants, we might be able to save a lot of the remaining biological diversity in and around our urban areas. If we do nothing, up to 90% is likely to disappear _even if we fix climate change tomorrow_. If we can effectively connect ecosystems through networks of naturalized former lawns, we could save even more.

This seems to me like a great way to address many of the crises we face today, from health to ecology to climate to economy. It also happens to be a way that anyone with control over any amount of land can take immediate action. Therefore I beseech you: Kill your lawn and plant native plants!

Why is it important for plants to be native? They'll help the climate either way, right? Well some 90% of insect herbivores are specialized on plants with which they co-evolved, so non-native plants are roughly an order of magnitude less ecologically useful. If ecosystems collapse and we lose our pollinators, it won't matter for long how many plants we have - because they and we are doomed without insects.

Why are lawns bad? Fertilizers, herbicides, maintenance equipment, water use, reduced groundwater capacity, and they are barren wastelands for almost any kind of hungry critter. We've converted far too much land to this mostly useless format and it is literally killing us.

* **Learn the Language:** We're translating ""climate change"" into ""economic boom,"" ""national pride,"" and ""secure future"" using the power of green tech and jobs.
* **Engage with Respect:** Leave the debate club tactics at home. We’re there to chat, share, and listen, not to argue.
* **Highlight Mutual Wins:** Show how renewable energy and conservation aren't just good for the planet—they're great for our economy and national security too.

**Your Eco-Quest:**

Head over to the places where GOP friends gather and start the convo. Think of it as an eco-diplomatic mission. And if you're up for it, take a peek at my kickoff post on Truth Social to get the vibe: [https://truthsocial.com/@jaredchristensen/posts/111936768009038375](https://truthsocial.com/@jaredchristensen/posts/111936768009038375)

**The Goal:** It’s not about changing minds overnight but opening hearts to the idea that caring for our planet is in everyone's best interest, regardless of political stripes.

**Why This Mission?** Because fighting for our planet requires all hands on deck. We need to build bridges, not walls, and show that green solutions can resonate with everyone—yes, even in GOP land.

Who's ready to be an eco-ambassador? Let’s make green the color of patriotism, prosperity, and a brighter future for all! 🌟🇺🇸💚","Let's Talk Climate in GOP-land: A Fun Mission!",1,16,0,"2024-02-15 18:03:29"

My name is Daniel Penny. I'm a journalist who writes for The New York Times, GQ, The New Yorker, and many other outlets.

I  wanted to introduce myself and share a new project I think folks on  this forum would be interested in. It's a podcast about the intersection  of masculinity and the climate crisis called [Non-toxic.](https://open.spotify.com/episode/336QH0uLCQmH2SuLdHs801?si=4SAenBfHQVS809cgMfqTXw&amp;nd=1)

The show follows an interview format, featuring conversations with experts   and regular guys who are interested in connecting the dots between the  manosphere and the atmosphere and doing something to fix this mess we're in.  
Hosted by me (Daniel Penny) and environmental journalist Andrew Lewis, episodes feature conversations with guests like **Andrea Crosta** (Director of Earth League International), **Daniel Goldhaber** (director of *How to Blow Up a Pipeline*), **JP Charisma** (one of Tiktok's biggest native plant gardeners), and **Bob Hendrikx** (inventor and bio-designer).  
Ultimately, *Non-toxic* is meant to be well-informed, but a little more irreverent than what  you hear on NPR or the BBC--more in the vein of *Know Your Enemy* and *You're Wrong About*, with a little *Radiolab*  thrown in.

[You can listen ](https://open.spotify.com/episode/336QH0uLCQmH2SuLdHs801?si=4SAenBfHQVS809cgMfqTXw)wherever  you find podcasts. I'd love to hear what this group thinks of the show and how you all moving forward with actions during the hottest summer  the earth has ever known.

Get our newsletter
We made the first assessment of burning on Scottish moorlands over the past 38 years using images from Nasa’s Landsat satellites. These satellites have been snapping pictures of our entire planet every few days since the 1980s. Fires leave behind a burn scar that is visible in these images. Through careful analysis, we can map the areas burned and track changes in burning over time.

We found that the area of moorland being burned increased between 1985 and 2022 – but not by much.

&gt;Of the tested predictors, mean annual temperature (MAT) was the most important variable in explaining cross-site variability of τi for all three soil carbon pools

Of course.

&gt;To explore the extent to which the intrinsic turnover times translate into the actual ones due to environmental constraints8, we compared our estimates with the radiocarbon-derived carbon age as a surrogate of realized or apparent turnover times (Supplementary Table 1). We find that soil τi is more than 16 times shorter than the actual one across the globe (316 yr versus 5,238 yr), and this value is largest in tundra (58.6) and boreal forests (18) but smallest in tropical forests (4.4) (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 4).

Which means that the model is very wrong... They can use the error to adjust, but it's not a good sign. I don't see any ""limitations"" section.

&gt;Such a reversal of the soil carbon balance is most prominent in the arctic tundra and boreal regions (Supplementary Fig. 10), and occurred there even without invoking warming-induced permafrost soil carbon degradation30,31. The arctic tundra and boreal region have the shortest soil-carbon intrinsic turnover time of all the regions (Fig. 2), and the release of environmental constraints via warming and the plant rhizosphere priming effect will largely decrease the apparent soil carbon turnover time, thereby inducing large soil carbon losses.

I'm not sure why they even included those cold soils. That's the planetary organic carbon freezer, and if/when it thaws, a lot of carbon is going up.

In general, they're trying to create a cool new model and to fly it a record distance too, which is very optimistic.","science","2024-01-11 10:42:32","193ao49","dumnezero",0,2,0,"True","2010-10-19 19:41:29",10889,3983,335752,706363,1056987,20,"","Soil May Be A Foe, Not Friend in Climate Fight: Where an earlier model would predict global soils trapping about 30 billion T of carbon by 2100 with mild climate change, the updated formula returned a 19 billion T discharge instead #GlobalCarbonFeeAndDividendPetition",0.96,20,0,"2024-01-10 15:20:02"

I wanted to share a student campaign that I and fellow students are leading at Cornell University – it's called the ""What's the Plan?"" campaign, and it's all about pushing for climate action plans in high-risk cities across the U.S.

We are seeking to promote the adoption of climate action plans in cities that are most at risk from the impacts of climate change and we are also working to raise awareness about Climate Action Plans through social media. Our focus has been on getting university students involved. But we would love support from a wider group of people who are interested in the issue.

Our campaign is using all the digital tools at our disposal to make it super easy for us to get involved. We have made pre-drafted emails to send to our elected officials, petitions to sign, and even creating and sharing our own content on social media to spread the word. We also have created data visualizations to better explain the issue. 

You can find out more about the ""What's the Plan?"" campaign on their website here, or check them out on social media:

With the recent popularity of AI and HPC (high-performance computing, what was traditionally known as supercomputing), data centers are naturally using more power and pumping out more carbon. That's something we cannot rewind the clock on, the genie is out of the bottle. But we can use other high-tech inventions to balance things out.

What the server company I work for is doing is offering our clients new ways to cool their data centers/ servers with the minimum amount of power necessary. There's an index we use in the industry called PUE, or power usage effectiveness. PUE equals overall data center power consumption divided by the power requirement of the processors. In simpler terms, it measures how much additonal power you're using to cool your servers and maintain stable operations. The ideal PUE is 1.0: that is, zero additional power is used to cool the servers. But currently the industry average is around 1.6. This means **60% more** power is used just to run the air conditioning for the servers.

We're trying to change the way the IT sector thinks about thermal management by introducing liquid cooling and immersion cooling solutions, which are more energy-efficient than air cooling. We're not the only ones doing this but we already have sucess stories with the [Japanese telecom giant KDDI](https://www.gigabyte.com/Article/japanese-telco-leader-kddi-invents-immersion-cooling-small-data-center-with-gigabyte?lan=en) and a [major Taiwanese semiconductor company](https://www.gigabyte.com/Article/semiconductor-giant-selects-gigabyte-s-two-phase-immersion-cooling-solution?lan=en). We're helping our customers use liquid coolant to cool their servers, either by running the coolant through tubes into the servers (conventional DLC liquid cooling) or dunking the servers directly into a coolant bath (immersion cooling). 

The benefits are twofold. First, liquid/immersion cooling consumes much less power than air conditioning, so we can help our clients improve PUE from the industry average of 1.6 to as low as **1.02** (just 2% more power to cool the servers instead of 60% more power). Second, chips cooled in this fashion can reach a higher TDP ceiling, which means they can achieve max performance without needing to be throttled to prevent overheating. If every chip is giving you max performance, you need fewer chips overall, so your carbon footprint is reduced further.

So for those of you who might be worried about what big tech is doing to balance their carbon emissions, there *is* a solution, it just takes time for this new technology to be more widely adopted. From our case studies you can see that some big global companies are already setting an example for everyone else. You can learn more about effective cooling technologies here ([link](https://www.gigabyte.com/Topics/Advanced-Cooling?lan=en)) if you like. In the immortal words for Douglas Adams, don't panic!

"107802","kuegd75",9,"Dozens of states are rolling out new climate plans to tackle planet-warming pollution in preparation to compete for billions of dollars of funding in President Joe Biden’s signature climate bill.

Forty-seven states and territories, including deeply red states like Alaska, Missouri, Montana, Utah and Alabama, are planning to install solar panels, replace aging oil-powered boilers with energy-efficient electric ones, install more electric vehicle charging stations, plant trees and implement farming practices to store carbon pollution in the soil.

States are hoping to pay for these upgrades using $4.6 billion in money from the Inflation Reduction Act, which the Environmental Protection Agency will roll out in the coming months.

Even as the Biden administration has moved aggressively to try to curb climate pollution, the approach from states has been piece-meal with just 33 states so far having their own climate action plans. That more than 10 are joining is significant, said Jennifer Macedonia, a deputy assistant administrator at the EPA.

“This is quite remarkable and new to have this breadth of coverage,” Macedonia told CNN. “This is quite unprecedented in terms of comprehensive climate action plans across states, and we also have metropolitan areas covering the country as well.""

"288399","kd1lcu8",2,"DUBAI — Mona Ainuu wiped away tears as she reacted to a draft agreement at the U.N. Climate Change Conference here, her voice shaking as she contemplated her small island nation of Niue sinking into the sea.

“We’re drowning with sea level rise,” Ainuu, the Niuean minister of natural resources, told reporters. “We’re losing our land. We’re losing people. … My 12-year old, what am I going to say to her when I come back?”

Like Ainuu, many delegates from vulnerable nations voiced frustration and anger at the draft deal unveiled Monday night at the climate summit, known as COP28. Unlike previous versions, the document did not [call for phasing out fossil fuels](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/10/un-climate-conference-fossil-fuels-dubai/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5), the root cause of rising global temperatures that have wrought devastation across the globe in the past year.

Instead, the deal suggests “reducing both consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and equitable manner"" so that the world reaches net-zero emissions by mid-century. The language reflects a compromise among negotiators from nearly 200 nations, including fossil-fuel-dependent countries such as the United Arab Emirates — the host of this year’s talks and the world’s seventh-largest oil producer.

The draft agreement is nearly the last step before the conclusion of COP28, at which, under the 2015 Paris agreement, countries are supposed to address how [to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/08/climate-change-threshold-cop28-dubai/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_9) (2.7 Fahrenheit). Poor and vulnerable countries have pushed for the agreement to include a phaseout of fossil fuels as the best chance of hitting the 1.5C target, a threshold beyond which scientists have warned of catastrophic effects, including flooded coastal cities and mass die-offs of coral reefs.

Climate groups widely critiqued the text as being watered down, and they said it reflected the world’s reluctance to emphatically close out the era of coal, oil and gas. But the text, in even mentioning the desired reduction of fossil fuel consumption and production, would break new territory — if agreed to. No prior agreement from international climate talks, including the 2015 Paris accord, has directly taken on the topic of fossil fuels, instead focusing on the need to reduce emissions.

Knowing what has happened in the past gives us information as to what we can expect as GHG levels continue to rise at accelerating rates.

For example, 51 million years ago CO2 levels peaked at 1600 ppm and global average temperature was over 12C warmer than today. 

Today’s CO2 levels in the atmosphere (420 ppm) are higher than anything until we go back to near the Miocene Climate Optimum (MCO) about 16 million years ago. When we surpass 480 ppm, we will have to go back to roughly 28 million years or so.

By comparing these paleo-CO2 findings with global temperatures we can see that the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) and Equilibrium System Sensitivity (ESS) were higher in the past. 

I should note that this paper used the mainstream IPCC ECS of 3C (for doubling of CO2) when the latest work from James Hansen argues that the sensitivity is a much higher 4.8C (with a range from 3.6C to 6.0C) which is a closer match to the higher sensitivities in the past.

The EU has introduced a border carbon tax to level the playing field for those businesses that comply with EU carbon legislation and certain products imported from nations that don't comply with similar domestic carbon rules. The US is also considering similar legislation.

https://www.npr.org/2023/05/17/1171238285/how-a-european-law-might-get-companies-around-the-world-to-cut-climate-pollution

""...the price tag on things made in China, India and other developing countries will probably go up even more. That's because companies there generate more climate pollution when they manufacture, since a larger share of electricity in the developing world comes from coal-fired power plants.""

All nations need to pull their weight.  

Nearly 25% of the nations in the world have a domestic carbon tax.  Carbon tax is simple and effective. What the UN needs to do is determine the minimum carbon tax all nations should apply to their domestic markets and with no exceptions. The major economies being, US, Japan, China, and the EU needs to take the EU border carbon tax and supercharge it.  Either the exporting nation has a thorough domestic carbon tax or all its products are subject to import tariffs so domestic companies that comply with domestic carbon tax aren't placed at a disadvantage.

A straightforward carbon tax will allow consumers/businesses to make informed purchasing decisions and encourage manufacturers to innovate to reduce their ghg emissions.

As citizens, we need to encourage our legislatures to adopt similar but more comprehensive carbon border taxes to weed out exporters that are polluting for free.","action","2023-07-12 19:10:45","14vx2qy","arcticouthouse",0,3,0,"True","2018-04-07 14:21:28",596,342,20046,30892,51876,7,"[https://serebrisky.com/2023/07/10/climate-action-simplified-thoughts-for-non-experts/](https://serebrisky.com/2023/07/10/climate-action-simplified-thoughts-for-non-experts/)","Climate Action Simplified: Thoughts for Non-Experts",1,7,0,"2023-07-10 15:23:30"

I chat about this UN report, or rather a chapter in a UN report on the Southern Oceans. What I really like in this report, and the purpose behind this video, are three illustrations in particular, showing you the main water flow around Antarctica, a cross section of the different water layers, and an excellent illustration that is centered on Antarctica, showing connections between Antarctic Circumpolar Currents to flow in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans from the surface to the deepest depths. 

Article: “Chapter 36H. Southern Ocean”:
https://www.un.org/depts/los/global_reporting/WOA_RPROC/Chapter_36H.pdf

“The Southern Ocean is the common denomination given to the southern extrema of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, extending southwards to the Antarctic Continent. 

Its main oceanographic feature, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), is the world’s only global current, flowing eastwards around Antarctica in a closed circulation with its flow unimpeded by continents. 

The ACC is today the largest ocean current, and the major means of exchange of water between oceans; it is believed to be the cause of the development of Antarctic continental glaciation by reducing meridional heat transport across the Southern Ocean.

The formation of eddies in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has a significant role in the distribution of plankton and in the warming observed in the
Southern Ocean.

As with the ACC, the westward-flowing Antarctic Coastal Current, or East Wind Drift (EWD), is wind-driven. 

These two current systems are connected by a series of gyres and retroflections (e.g., gyres in the Prydz Bay region, in the Weddell Sea, in the
Bellingshausen Sea)”

On the other hand, I've read in some places that Extinction Rebellion UK have committed to refraining from civil disobedience last year in the hope of gathering more public support - I was wondering if you know of more organisations that have made such commitments.

It is possible that we have reached that point with methane.

A few days ago I attended a webinar called “Methane Possible Tipping Points or Surprises”. 

Link: https://methane-possible-tipping-points-or-surprises.confetti.events/

Definitely, this webinar event is well worth watching (1.5 hour video presentation on link), but ONLY after watching this video first, of course:)

Basically, the sharp rise in global atmospheric methane concentrations since about 2007, coinciding with a continuing downward trend in the isotopic C-13 levels appear to be mostly do to enormous rises in methane emissions from tropical wetlands around the planet, with the lions share of the wetland methane originating from the African wetlands that are getting hotter, larger, and wetter as climate warming accelerates.

As I covered in a recent video, James Hansen’s landmark paper “Global Warming in the Pipeline” attributes most of this warming acceleration to a reduction of aerosols due to sulphur reductions by China and the Maritime Shipping Industry. 

I guess that is largely true, but I think that some of the strong warming increase can be attributed to the accelerating rise of methane, especially if we are really in a “Termination Zero Methane Event” as appears from data thus far, but this is by no means certain yet. If we are in Termination-0 then we can expect very strong and rapid methane increases over the next several decades, and these are feedbacks from the Earth wetland systems around the planet.

It is amazing to me that isotopic C-13 has declined so much recently, because fossil fuel emissions are rising at ever faster rates which should increase the isotopic C-13. What this can only mean is that methane emissions from the planetary systems is increasing that much faster than from fossil fuels that it is driving down the isotopic C-13 amounts. Very bad.

""Three-quarters of the oil used in 2050 is in sectors where it is not combusted. Around 0.8 Gt CO2 is emitted from oil use in 2050, mainly from aviation and trucks.""  This I can believe.  Looks like gas is the one they're saying will rely on CCUS:

""Around 60% of natural gas in 2050 is consumed in facilities equipped with CCUS.   
This includes 330 bcm of natural gas combined with CCUS to produce low-emissions   
hydrogen, 110 bcm used with CCUS in energy-intensive processes such as the production of cement, steel and primary chemicals, and 75 bcm used with CCUS in the power sector.""  


no mention of how many Gt of CO2 they're saying will need to be stored as a result of that\^ specifically.  In the CCUS section (2.3.1) it shows they assume 6Gt of CO2 accounted for by these technologies, including DAC.  That actually doesn't sound like a lot, but they're relying on 500B USD of investment to get to 1Gt by 2030, noting investment ""reached a new high of more than USD 3 billion in 2022"" hahahahahaahah makes it pretty hard to believe.  They're basically expecting a massive CCUS industry to come to life

on DAC specifically:

""The NZE Scenario requires around USD 70 billion average annual investment in DAC to 2050 and around 500 TWh of annual electricity generation in 2050 (equivalent to Canada's electricity demand in 2022)""

https://youtu.be/6p8zAbFKpW0

They basically mention all the offsets they found going to renewable production were all projects that were going to be built anyway.

My expertise is in the new york area 

Basically a state agency promises all developers that the utility legally has to buy any RECs from solar and wind energy production, giving them enough market confidence to built them. They can sell RECs themselves first, but any unsold recs need to be bought by the utility. Which increases the price of electricity

https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/All-Programs/Clean-Energy-Standard/Renewable-Generators-and-Developers/RES-Tier-One-Eligibility

This became really relevant with ""Tier 4 recs"" which are injected directly into nyc. Since there are not any renewables in nyc and it costs a lot to get them there the REC price is really expensive. Tier 1 is a lot cheaper since most of those projects would be built anyway and there are lots of unsold recs.

Tricky issue. Recs can be useful, they often aren't, and id rather affect my own electricity supply and co2 emissions so I dont have to go down the rabbit hole of tracking the effectiveness and realness of the offset/rec.

I buy monthly co2 direct air capture recs.

"185106","kk8s4ph",2,"Let's see what the paper is about, because the clickbait title sound like clickbait.

&gt;How UA compares with conventional agriculture depends on the crops grown, growing systems and local climate3. It is unclear what forms of UA are environmentally friendly, because case studies of individual cities typically only assess one form of UA

This just sounds like they're discovering the problem of ""locavore"" footprint. Meaning that eating locally doesn't guarantee lower GHG emissions because the production processes can be more energy intensive or polluting than transportation from a place where those production processes are way less energy intensive and polluting.

&gt;Collective gardens are the most carbon-intensive form of UA (μ = 0.81 kgCO2e per serving, 7.50 kgCO2e kg−1). Individual gardens and urban farms are similar on average (both produce 0.34 kgCO2e per serving), but variation among urban farms leaves them statistically indistinguishable from conventional farms (P = 0.33). In fact, most urban farms are carbon-competitive with conventional farms (median = 0.08 kgCO2e per serving when one particularly carbon-intensive urban farm is excluded from the analysis)

It's likely a measure of community resource investment with poor planning. Let's see.

&gt;Nonetheless, the average vegetable at the local grocer outperforms the average vegetable on UA sites in all five countries (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Probably because professionals know how to produce more with less and reach economies of scale. 

&gt;For example, the median urban tomato (0.17 kgCO2e per serving) outperforms conventional tomatoes (μ = 0.27 kgCO2e per serving). Although, on average, urban tomatoes are more carbon-intensive than conventional tomatoes (P = 0.02), this low median demonstrates that UA sites often outperform conventional tomato growing. This is largely due to the carbon-intensive greenhouses that supply most tomatoes to our case cities, as well as sub-optimal distribution patterns of the crop from farm to city

if you're growing tomatoes in an open garden, it means that you can grow tomatoes outside and you get free zero-carbon energy from the Sun. Such comparisons should not be made in the first place.

&gt;This suggests that urban food growers could maximize carbon benefits (or minimize carbon impacts) by selecting crops conventionally grown or distributed using carbon-intensive methods. 

Yes, that's actually the case where transportation emissions are way worse.

&gt; Urban farms are most likely to be climate-friendly (43% of urban farm sites), followed by individual gardens (25% of sites).

the professionals win. I'm shocked.

&gt;neither environmental actions (for example, presence of solar panels) nor expressed values are predictive of carbon emissions (Supplementary Table 3)

this isn't a ""fake it till you make it"" situation.

&gt;We identify three best practices crucial to making low-tech UA carbon-competitive with conventional agriculture: (1) extend infrastructure lifetimes, (2) use urban waste as inputs and (3) generate high levels of social benefits.

All 3 are tied to professional/commercial efforts. Knowing how to build a long-lasting farm is part of a plan. Connecting urban waste and handling it also requires some extra means and know-how. Social benefits means especially that the harvest isn't just for a small minority, which also displaces supply from other sources.

&gt;Infrastructure is the largest driver of carbon emissions at low-tech UA sites (63% of impacts)

Yep. You can't use farms like sandboxes.

&gt;The carbon footprint of compost grows tenfold when methane-generating anaerobic conditions persist in compost piles39. This is common during small-scale composting, and home compost is the highest-impact input on 22 of the 73 UA sites studied (Supplementary Table 4). Cities can offset this risk by centralizing compost operations for professional management or by training farmers on proper composting practices

Knowledge. (Otherwise, the compost bin is like the rumen of a cow.) 

&gt;Instead, sites primarily used potable municipal water sources or groundwater wells, consistent with the underutilization of rainwater seen across past research9. Irrigation from these sources emits GHGs from pumping, water treatment and distribution, and this rose to as high as 83% of total emissions on one UA site

*points at MULCHING IS OBLIGATORY sign*

&gt;UA practitioners overwhelmingly reported improved mental health, diets and social networks.

Indeed, it's very nice.

&gt;This study takes a conservative approach by allocating all supplies and irrigation to food production, and infrastructure is allocated to food and social co-benefits based on interviews with farmers and standardized calculations (for example, 10% of a raised bed allocated to non-food if 10% of the area grows ornamentals).

That's fair. The only ornamental plants that should be used are the ones that can be mixed in to help, such as those that attract pollinators, spiders and so on.

&gt;Although this threshold appears high, evidence suggests this is attainable. Cost–benefit analysis of a collective garden in the UK estimated that social benefits, such as improved well-being and reduced hospital admissions, accounted for 99.4% of total economic value generated on-site47. Because emissions allocation often follows economic value generation46, growing spaces that maximize social benefits can outcompete conventional agriculture when UA benefits are considered holistically.

Indeed. They're describing the benefit of a type of park. Don't call it a farm, call it a ""food park"" or ""garden park"".

this is a 400 hp engine that only weighs 88 pounds, in comparison a 271hp for mustang motor from the 60s was over 180 pounds, while things are being done to lessen emissions. Hell, there's a motorcycle that gets almost 200mpg.

People just get on this there can be only one mentality when the answer is going to be a multitude of things working harmoniously together. Most people don't understand that you can't just shunt the power to the ground and you can't ramp up production of energy too fast so you have to try and create a balanced energy grid. With changing weather that balancing becomes difficult, too many people, more difficult etc.

It might be easy to say Nuclear is the way to go but with it's complexity only a handful of people in the world can do it, renewables are a easy solution to a complex problem, but they're not the be all end all.

I'm building a passive house which uses 80-90% less energy and maintains the temperature better, I'm in a cold climate so it makes sense to, in the south the same can be done with less materials, some places need basements, some places don't, etc. Although I am thinking of going with solar myself because I can get the energy I need without sacrifice of comfort, but I can do it all myself so it saves me money.","science","2024-03-19 09:56:49","1bgi09r","Fit-Pressure4770",0,1,0,"True","2023-08-09 13:00:31",0,0,3,2820,2823,95,"","New Study Shows Planting Trees May Not Be as Good for the Climate as Previously Believed",0.79,95,0,"2024-03-16 22:32:09"

Everything in this area is not greenwashing even if this article wants you to think so. There is a quickly growing number of well intentioned good actors working hard to develop and scale up different types of CDR. Why not discuss how we can help them with the right legislation and economic support. 

To, like this article, go on harping about how small the industry is today is not very constructive. It’s a bit silly, like someone poo-pooing solar back in 2000.

Dutch Creek Farms, where President Biden will visit today, is a family farm that grows corn and soybeans and raises hogs.

This was an interesting interview with Leah Stokes. I think she does a great job blending science, hope, anger, and excitement into her approach to communicating effective approaches to climate action as well as her overall theory of how to accelerate collective action to tackle climate change (basically a combination of strategic individual actions and collective organizing for specific climate policies that transform the infrastructure in which those individual actions take place). She also mentioned a couple of books relevant to climate activism and campaigns that caught my attention so listing them here:

How much is enough depends on how much you reasonably feel you can contribute. No one else can tell you that.

It also varies as to exactly what you can do. Some people don't feel able to actually physically break into places, sit in roads and so on - particularly if they're in demographics who are typically more likely to be mistreated by the police. But, those people can still join the movement and find other ways to contribute. They can write blogs about it, or become a legal advisor, or help design the placards for the protest. Even just sending messages of support to the people who have been jailed can help - it keeps those people's motivations up, and makes it more likely that they'll have the energy to continue campaigning in the future.

So, I’ve been climate conscious since I was around 13/14. Been terrified of it and haven’t talked about it ever since, driving myself insane in the process, several times. I’ve done many things since I learned about it, going for more vegan options/turning off at outlets etc, but the one thing i haven’t done is go out and protest. A lot of people, mainly activists, say that protest is the most effective form of direct climate action, but ive never been to any protest of any cause. I dont know what it is about them that gets me, but they just get my heart racing, fear-wise. Trouble is, now I just don’t feel like I deserve to be accepted as someone who isnt complicit in the awful things to come. I follow a lot of activists from many different groups online (mainly from JSO) who only really post things about how not doing a certain action is complicitness, normally protest. If they dont say it, to me they imply it at least. I try to convince myself that theyre meant for those who are just sitting bakc and doing nothing, but my brain still tells me that theyre meant for me too.

If you want, start looking for jobs in the climate space- there are many out there!! [And plenty of people who have absolutely ZERO background in science are getting hired.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-01-05/how-to-quit-your-job-to-fight-climate-change) The climate sector knows that we need more and more and more people. So yeah you might not be qualified for all jobs, but there are plenty of jobs that WILL take you. MANY have the mentality of skills can be learned- passion and genuine care for the planet can not be.  
Also, there are plenty of climate organizations and businesses that still need regular admin stuff, backend tech needs etc. So there is still plenty of opportunity to do something you already know how to do just for a job in the environmental/climate space.

The most important thing about the environmental/climate space is NOTHING is a silver bullet solution, for every suggestion that works for one person/community/country/biome, it won't work for others. It doesn't make it not valid, it just makes it not the solution for that person/community/country etc.

&gt;*It didn’t take much for Eric Swenson to start a chain reaction that in less than two years would prompt the world’s most influential entertainment company to make a powerful clean energy commitment.*

&gt;*Swenson was at Disneyland with his wife, celebrating her birthday. He was startled when he realized that the classic 1955 Autopia ride was as “loud and foul” as ever, with oil-fueled cars spewing lung-damaging, planet-warming gases.*

&gt;*“When I saw Autopia was still like 1,000 lawnmowers running at the same time, I took pictures and sent a note to Paul,” he said.*

&gt;*That would be longtime electric vehicle advocate Paul Scott. Startled by Swenson’s message, Scott and fellow advocate Zan Dubin filed complaints about Autopia’s air pollution with California regulators, raising questions about possible health dangers to guests waiting in line, and to Disney employees working the attraction, breathing in those fumes for hours on end.*

&gt;*Dubin and Scott also reached out to an L.A. Times climate reporter (me), urging me to write about the opportunity for Disney to convert Autopia to electric cars. I started pressing the company for answers on why it hadn’t done so yet — especially in an area of the park known as Tomorrowland, intended by Walt Disney to showcase technologies that would create a better future.*

&gt;*Lo and behold, Disney quickly promised to ditch gas engines at Autopia. A win for the climate and for our bodies.*

&gt;*Then last week, under continued pressure from a growing coalition of electric car proponents, Disney went further, pledging that Autopia’s new vehicles would be fully electric, not hybrids. The company also promised to stop operating the combustion vehicles by fall 2026 — a much firmer commitment than its initial timeline of “in the next few years.”*

&gt;*On Sunday, Swenson was among two dozen climate advocates who gathered outside Walt Disney Studios in Burbank to cheer the company’s action — and celebrate their own achievement. Dubin led the group in a collective call of “thank you, Disney.”*

Great post .. but I think if we get to the +10C that starts this water-vapor runaway process, there wont be many humans around at that point.

“The Earth is a wonderful blue and green dot covered with oceans and life, while Venus is a yellowish sterile sphere that is not only inhospitable but also sterile. However, the difference between the is only a few tens of degrees in temperature. A team of astronomers… has achieved a world’s first by managing to simulate the entirety of the runaway greenhouse process which can transform the climate of a planet from idyllic and perfect for life, to a place more than harsh and hostile. The scientists have also demonstrated that from initial stages of the process, the atmospheric structure and cloud coverage undergo significant changes, leading to an almost-unstoppable and very complicated to reverse runaway greenhouse effect. On Earth, a global average temperature rise of just a few tens of degrees, subsequent to a slight rise of the Sun’s luminosity, would be sufficient to initiate this phenomenon and to make our planet inhabitable. These results are published in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics.”

“The idea of a runaway of the greenhouse effect is not new. In this scenario, a planet can evolve from a temperate state like on Earth to a true hell, with surface temperatures above 1000°C. The cause? Water vapor, a natural greenhouse gas. Water vapor prevents the solar irradiation absorbed by Earth to be reemitted towards the void of space, as thermal radiation. It traps heat a bit like a rescue blanket. A dash of greenhouse effect is useful – without it, Earth would have an average temperature below the freezing point of water, looking like a ball covered with ice and hostile to life.

On the opposite, too much greenhouse effect increases the evaporation of oceans, and thus the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. “There is a critical threshold for this amount of water vapor, beyond which the planet cannot cool down anymore. From there, everything gets carried away until the oceans end up getting fully evaporated and the temperature reaches several hundred degrees,”

“One of the key points of the study describes the appearance of a very peculiar cloud pattern, increasing the runaway effect, and making the process irreversible. “From the start of the transition, we can observe some very dense clouds developing in the high atmosphere. Actually, the latter does not display anymore the temperature inversion characteristic of the Earth atmosphere and separating its two main layers: the troposphere and the stratosphere. The structure of the atmosphere is deeply altered,”

Article:
“Exoplanets’ climate – it takes nothing to switch from habitable to hell.”
https://www.aanda.org/component/content/article/208-press-releases/2023-press-releases/2930-exoplanets-climate-it-takes-nothing-to-switch-from-habitable-to-hell

“The Earth is thus not so far from this apocalyptical scenario. “Assuming this runaway process would be started on Earth, an evaporation of only 10 meters of the oceans’ surface would lead to a 1 bar increase of the atmospheric pressure at ground level. In just a few hundred years, we would reach a ground temperature of over 500°C. Later, we would even reach 273 bars of surface pressure and over 1 500°C, when all of the oceans would end up totally evaporated,”

A few tens of degrees C to trigger this runaway greenhouse effect may seem like a lot, but it’s not. Remember than James Hansen’s climate sensitivity value is a nominal 4.8C (actually between 3.6C and 6.0C) so it’s not too far off.

I do not believe they are being funded in adequate amounts and in all the places necessary to prevent extinction. 

In Pakistan, for example, where 33 million people were impacted by the flooding that had 1/3 of the entire country under water, including some villages under 33ft of water, and wiping out over a million acres of crops and killing over 1 million farm animals,they have ‘not’ recovered in any way shape or form. 

And look at La Haina. Or just turn on the international news. Almost every day ‘now’ there are calamitous events where thousands lose ‘everything’. Where are all these trillions of dollars for restoring people’s lives going to come from? The world is already ‘broke’ from dealing with the covid pandemic, lol! Our country has a ‘huge’ deficit that is only going ‘up’, and aren’t we one of the wealthiest countries on the planet? 

And what is the world going to do when there are hundreds of millions of climate refugees? Where will they go? This is not one country’s problem like the Irish potato famine when thousands of Irish refugees came here to avoid starvation. We’re taking hundreds of millions of people with nothing but the shirts on their backs.

It’s long been proven that the best way to deal with calamity is to have a preventative outlook, rather than one that is reactive. This is where we have screwed up. By ‘not’ listening to the climate scientists who have been warning of this for decades we have killed off any chance of getting out of this mess without a giant cluster f*#k!

Note: I am not a climate scientist and all of the above is my ‘opinion’ based on what I know. There really is ‘no’ way now for us to accurately predict the future, lol! So I ultimately have no idea what will happen, nor do most of us.

I’m 19, due to turn 20 next year, but with all of… everything happening to the world, I’m honestly not confident I’ll even make it to 50. I have autism and ADHD, plus I was born when the internet was blooming, so those combined make me dwell on negative events far more than positive ones, even more so with what’s happening to the climate around me.

I had a mental breakdown at work last month due to the heat wave, and that really was what led me to be scared for my future. I want to get into college and own my own home. I know there’s plenty of things I can do to cut back on my own emissions, but even doing that wouldn’t help one bit at all. I already use Ecosia but I’m fearing that alone isn’t enough. Doom and gloom have just perpetuated no matter what around my head, and with the possibility of exceeding 2C that’s not at all making it better. I want to hold on to some kind of hope for a better world, but every news article saying the opposite, that ecosystems are collapsing is shooting down all that, and I fear I’m playing right into the oil companies’ hands.

I’m sorry for being melodramatic, but it’s what’s going through my head. Also sorry for the long message, I’m on mobile. But my hope is crumbling by the day as every positive piece of news about endangered species growing in numbers and renewable energy skyrocketing is obliterated with news about Canada, the Amazon, the Arctic, and coastal cities being ravaged by hurricanes.

My points are: He lives with his three kids in a huge, gas heated, not isolated mansion with big old window fronts in Germany. He has an outside pool that he's heating in winter with electricity. He has a sauna in the basement. They're only drying their laundry with a tumble dryer. He changed three cars in five years, the last two are teslas though. He took a flight with his whole family to thailand this year and now he wants to make 10 friends fly for a weekend for his birthday to a place three hours flighttime away. I'm not judging him but at least he should keep it down telling everyone how dangerous climate change is. 

His points are: Teslas are more sustainable than fuel cars. He lives in a small town and needs a car with the kids *(there's busses and trains but that takes more time than with the car yes)*. he barely eats meat. he didn't shop clothes since a year. he has a contract for eco-electricity.

  Even then; to get the East and West on the same page and walk hand in hand right now is an impossibility. Asia is responsible for 53 percent of global emissions now; which I'm sure you know.  China is the actual global tipping point presently; and because of the unprecedented growth of the nation it is going to be exceedingly difficult to convince the CCP that they must ""do more"". At present our countries seem to want to go to war anyway about things that have nothing to do with climate change.
   Let's not talk about Russia or the Middle East. 
  The U.S. is responsible for a quarter of what has already been put out there as far as emissions and I'm sure a lot of countries feel who the hell are we to tell anyone to stop doing exactly what we did to get where we are at? 
 What's so sad is that there is no other way that I see other than the people of the richest nations to join and force change. 
 We've seen what these massive corporations are doing. So how long do we let them lie to our face swearing they will change when they've already proven all they care about is $$$. So they lobby to enact laws against demonstrations or better yet get new laws up that incarcerate anyone willing to do more than hold a sign. They will destroy the earth so long as it doesn't alter their bottom line. 
  High end income or first world peoples emit a lot more than a developing country's people for obvious reasons. Every country that is developing and prospering wants to live as comfortable as the ones they see all around them. 

  China has enacted emissions taxes and plans to drop to zero emissions by 2060. They're in front of the U.S. as far as plans go. They're sort of acting like they want to change.  Don't get it twisted, there's been no relaxing of coal burning there though. The limits a corporation can burn there can just be bought for now. The rest of Asia will follow what the rest of the world does. Russia is a ??? The middle East is going to suck up every bit of financial gain that can be had before they stop. Europe seems to be actively participating and trying. The problem is these changes haven't changed a damn thing yet. Australia is not. In fact they're going the opposite direction. New laws to cut down and burn more resources.  Idk what the North American plan is. Lie more maybe. At least China is doing something I guess. They're actually leading the world in renewables yet lead in emissions as well.   Africa and South America I've barely looked into. I think they've barely looked into it themselves. 
 Then there is every individual poor country out there that wants a piece of prosperity. What do they do now? 
 Cost effectiveness seems to be everyone's driving point.

Don't get me wrong.  All of these tiny steps are potentially positive, except that they are far, far, far too little, far, far, far too late.  They would have been good news in 1982, but in 2022, it's an admission that they aren't really going to do anything.

In order to avoid +2º, we would need to reduce emissions by 90% in ten years, which would mean a decrease in emissions of over 9%, per year, every year, starting in 2023.

But I guarantee you that we will emit more in 2023 than 2022.  I'd bet any money that emissions in 2032 will be higher than they are in 2022.

&gt; The good thing about Egypt was that there is now widespread pressure that the UAE won't repeat with such kind of treatment of activists at COP28. 

Surely it would have been better in the first place not to have flown thousands of people from all over the world into a dystopian dictatorship which flouts pollution laws and human rights?

I am requesting that you call your state reps and governors and ask that a law be created to encourage biodiversity in areas that have been interrupted by human activity. 

Unless someone can recommend something else, I am asking that for every 5 square feet 7+ plant species must be present and for every 15 square feet an additional 7 more native plants need to be present or planted, including a variety of trees.

I am requesting that we restrict mowing only to areas with high volumes of foot traffic (both publicly and privately—an entire lawn for aesthetic reasons is not justifiable). 

Request the limitation of mowing to very specific dates of the year, to encourage wildflower growth, to reduce carbon production and fossil fuel consumption, and to help the bees, butterflies and more biodiversity.

Also remind them about the Paris Agreement our dedication to reduce carbon and that mowing more than we need to, produces more carbon and consumes fossil fuel at a much higher rate. 

I also think it’s good to request that next generational planting be done alongside older growth in interrupted areas at the quarter and half cycle of each tree (way before a tree falls sick or becomes an issue (but not to remove the sick tree until it does indeed become an issue).

Request that for any tree removed, that 10 varied trees be planted in close proximity to one another and that they are planted within the same zip code and/or ecosystem. 

Request that tree varieties vary in rows when planting in strips (not all of the same tree on a block, they should vary and alternate). Three trees, three varieties. 

Request that towns plant more densely (it’s okay if the branches touch and break)

Request that no raking/removal of leaves be done for a percentage of property to encourage soil production, ground coverage, warmth and habitat for hibernating animals; and to restore water tables. What do we think is fair to nature here? 80% of exposed property not be raked?

Protection of seed producing trees. It often takes trees 20-30 years to mature and they are usually removed because of their mess, and people’s fear of their car becoming slightly dinged up. These trees should be honored over our vehicles’ appearances and other “justifications.”

If the oil companies want to play dirty, let's do the same right back. Elections are won by making people hate the other guy and too many attacks on Big Oil rely on factual arguments that don't show them for the villains they are. Unfortunately, facts alone don't move the dial of public opinion. We have the science, they have their increasingly desperate publicity campaigns. They think we can't coordinate against them, I say we can.

Let's see how much damage we can do to the fossil fuel industry's image. I'm talking full on, coordinated online campaign, across as many social media platforms as possible. Decide a few key talking points and hashtags right here in this thread - then unleash them at peak usage time, preferably after big climate news stories come out that we can build off.

We need to find the most destuctive talking points. I mean using not just facts but feelings.  They have to lie, we don't. Use humour, incite fear, outrage, disgust - in other words make it as likely as possible to go viral.

Additionally, they say that the implications between a variety of the RCP scenarios are negligible and don't significantly diverge until after 2045, and that even where they do diverge, the consequences of the worst case scenario don't become significant until after 2100:

&gt; However, RCP 8.5 does not diverge from the lower-range scenarios until 2045, and the additional melting mainly affects shallower regions of the ice shelves, which are less important for sea-level rise. The choice of scenario is likely to become more important in the twenty-second century and beyond.

My idea is to artificially increase the earth's albedo, that is, how reflective the earth's surface is. I did some searching and found that there were attempts to do so by putting more chemicals into the air but I don't know how I feel about this.  


So my idea is to cover 16,000 square miles of the earth's surface in white cotton with reflective biodegradable/edible sequins sewn into every inch of it. As for where to put this behemoth of a piece of cotton, over the pacific ocean, as oceans don't have a high albedo. I feel like cotton would be the safest and if you put it about 10 feet over the surface with buoys. This would quickly alter the albedo of the planet which would help combat the climate crisis though it may not stop it, it might buy us some time. It could be made larger if desired too and replaced if needed.  


Please what are your thoughts on this idea, could this help, do you have any suggestions to improve the idea and would it even be feasible? Also... sorry if I used the wrong flair/posted in the wrong area.","Increase earth's albedo",0.38,0,0,"2024-03-31 06:05:30"

- Replace the current generation of HFC refrigerants which have 12,900x the greenhouse effect of CO2, with either the natural refrigerant ammonia like is now happening in Europe, or HFOs, which though 185x the GHG clout of CO2 is still a vast improvement over HFCs.  

Refrigerants solves a little less than 10% of our GHG problem, but refrigerant use is expected to grow as formerly temperate regions shift to buying air conditioners.

Another 30% of our GHG problem comes from methane:

- Go all-in on stopping methane leaks from oil and gas infrastructure.  EVERY natural gas well, storage, pipeline or end-use equipment in the world leaks, including your Weber or kitchen stove or space heating or hot water heating.  But on this one, the Big Kahunas are the world’s often filthy oilfields, starting at home with the Permian in west Texas.  

- Go all-in on the vast power of methane leaks from the world’s landfills with improved covers plus diversion of green waste and, vitally, food waste to more beneficial uses.  Conveniently, unlike in oil and gas, there are mere hundreds of landfills in most nations, not tens of thousands like in the fossil fuel industry, so perhaps that lends focus to activism... fewer, bigger targets: Super Emitter Landfills.

- Go all-in on methane emissions from dairy and beef cattle manure, and their burps.  This is harder than it sounds, because of high customer demand.  But in my state of California, an oil state, cows literally cause 55% of methane emissions.

Methane has 84x the GHG power of CO2 over the vital short term, but is one of only a few quick wins available to humanity to prevent a tipping right dang now, because it’s half life in the atmosphere is only 8 years versus CO2’s 53 years!!!

I have launched a Kickstarter campaign to print 1000 books.

[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sinchan/tara-and-friends-the-arctic-melt-a-childrens-book?ref=ebdnnf](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sinchan/tara-and-friends-the-arctic-melt-a-childrens-book?ref=ebdnnf)

Here is what makes the book unique:

* The book discusses the complex subject of Climate change with your children in an easy to understand language.
* The book provides young girls with inspirational female environmentalists role models.
* The book has an action plan where children will be encouraged to write letters to their leaders and otherwise take action on climate change.

I have partnered with Saving Nature, an amazing grassroots organization at the frontlines of the fight against Climate change. Every purchase plants one tree.

I sincerely hope that this book helps (at least a little) in some meaningful way.

I would love your support on this project. If pledging isn’t in your budget, please share this with your social networks.

Thanks so much for your help, I really appreciate it!

I can understand the panic surrounding climate change, especially amongst my generation. As someone who's part of Gen Z, it's hard not to feel doom and gloom when looking at the current pace of transition to renewable energy. I'm no scientist, but I've read about the history of ambitious projects like the space race and wartime mobilization. 

It seems clear to me that one of the main reasons the green transition is happening too slowly is a lack of large-scale government investment and support and pushback from big corporations. When nations put their full economic might behind goals in the past, like reaching the moon, they were able to achieve tremendous progress in just a few short years. 

Some say we're already in a crisis with climate change, so why aren't we treating it with the same urgency as we did with World War II? If we organized our society and poured resources into renewable technology on that kind of scale, I really believe we could make huge strides towards meeting the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement. 

Of course, there are no easy answers and switching our entire energy system overnight would be incredibly difficult. But it seems the longer we delay serious action and investment in climate solutions, the worse off future generations like mine will be. I can't help but feel we need to muster the collective will to declare something like a ""war on climate change"" and start mobilizing all of society's resources toward protecting our planet.

&gt;Swaths of forest across the state are still blackened by recent wildfires and those that burned decades ago. Millions of trees were destroyed by high-intensity wildfires in the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. Without intervention, researchers said Tuesday, it will take centuries for the forests to return. 

&gt;State Forester Laura McCarthy said New Mexico needs between 150 and 390 million seedlings to restore forests in burned areas. An additional 26 million seedlings are needed in the burn scar of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, researchers said. 

&gt;So the vision for the New Mexico Forest Reforestation Center, with the help of state and federal money, is to grow five million tree seedlings a year in Mora to be strategically planted in burn scars on public and private land across the Southwest. At the moment, the center produces just 300,000 seedlings annually.

&gt;Xochitl Torres Small, the Las Cruces-raised deputy secretary for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, spoke at the small facility for the event Tuesday at the base of fire-scarred mountains in Mora. She said the $11.5 million federal dollars for the center will help it put a dent in the tree deficit accumulated over years of high-intensity fires in a drying Southwest. 

&gt;She also apologized on behalf of the agency for the wildfire, caused by federal Forest Service crews in two botched prescribed burns that combined almost exactly two years ago. (The USDA oversees the Forest Service.)

&gt;“There’s of course symbolism in the fact that we are talking about seedlings in the nursery,” Torres Small told attendees. “When it comes to rebuilding, the hardest part of rebuilding is trust, especially when our relationships have never been perfect when it comes to USDA. And yet, every year we show up to do the work to try to make that relationship better.” 

&gt;The federal money includes $10 million from the USDA and an additional $1.5 million via Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office. Over the last two legislative sessions, state lawmakers approved $22.5 million for the center, according to the budget legislation. 

&gt;But it will cost about $100 million to equip the center with new greenhouses and additional technology for testing drought-resistant saplings, researchers said. The researchers come from the University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, New Mexico Highlands University and the state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. 

&gt;To fill the funding gap, the state is finalizing a request of $69 million to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Dylan Fuge, EMNRD deputy secretary. FEMA is overseeing a $4 billion fund Congress approved to compensate victims of the federally caused wildfire.

&gt;The state’s request for the reforestation center funds will be part of a claim submitted on behalf of all state agencies for losses they endured in the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. In an interview with Source New Mexico, Fuge could not say when the claim would be sent, except that he hoped to sign off on his department’s portion within a week.  

&gt;“New Mexico state government and our partner agencies in the federal government are here to help, and the governor’s administration will continue pushing our federal partners and related state agency agencies to provide the relief funding to impacted communities,” Huge told the audience on behalf of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who was scheduled to attend the meeting but canceled Tuesday morning. 

&gt;*Stress tests for trees*

&gt;If the center receives necessary funding, researchers hope to build 160,000 square feet of greenhouses by 2028. That’s 20 times the 8,000 square feet the center has now. They also hope to invest in research technology to identify the most drought-resistant ponderosa pines and other tree species to give them the best shot of survival in burned, dry forests. Current capacity allows the center to re-plant 1% of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burn scar, said research director Owen Burney. “That doesn’t include other fires or future fires,” he said. “So we are not in the capacity we need to be in for the backlog.”

&gt;But growing the seedlings isn’t enough. The seedlings also have to survive in an increasingly arid, wildfire-prone landscape, and they’ll have to take root in areas of severe burn, with charred soil and little shade. To improve the seedlings’ odds, researchers subject some seedlings to drought conditions and select for re-planting strains that can handle the heat. 

&gt;For a study published in December 2022, researchers at the center planted about 2,000 pine, aspen, locust and other seedlings in area of high-severity burns in the scar of the 2011 Las Conchas Fire to measure the effects of things like climate, topography or biology on whether seedlings survived and grew. 

&gt;The average survival rate after a three-year period was 20%, according to the paper, but researchers said they emerged with a better understanding of the typographical features, stressors and other factors that could help seedlings thrive. That means paying close attention to micro-climates and planting on northern and eastern hillslopes, among other things, researchers said.

&gt;Fuge, the EMNRD deputy secretary, said the model scientists developed could increase the survival rate of seedlings from about 25% to between 60% and 90%. 

&gt;One unique factor that could complicate replanting trees in the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, researchers acknowledged, is the widespread aerial reseeding of grasses across public and private forests. 

&gt;The Forest Service dropped tons of seeds from helicopters to stabilize the soil against post-fire flooding, but lingering grass and rye from that effort could compete with baby trees, researchers said. It’s one of many factors they’ll have to consider when it comes time to plant. 

&gt;Expanding the number of seedlings and ensuring their survival will require additional funds, but researchers said it is a vital effort to sequester carbon, restore watersheds and return fire-scarred landscapes to thriving forests within a human lifespan.

It's time to [attack](https://twitter.com/FrankKane80/status/1700885098738937995?s=20).

First, I want to **thank you all**. I made the original post because I could not understand how oil companies were not being blamed and attacked more. Based on the amount of support, I guess I’m not alone in feeling that way. If you already know the drill, skip the next 3 paragraphs.

If you haven’t read the previous posts, basically fossil fuel companies have known they were causing climate change for decades. [They lied about it](https://www.ciel.org/news/oil-tobacco-denial-playbook/) on an industrial scale and are still trying to stop the energy transition because **they want to keep selling fuel that heats the planet.** Apparently childrens' futures don’t matter to oil companies. They continue to spread lies and try to reframe the narrative, paying everyone from tiktokers, thinktanks and lobbyists to do so.

Oil companies are paying people to speak in their defence because they are guilty, and they know what the public believes matters. They know when public opinion turns, they are going to have Big Problems. That shift in opinion is already happening. Let’s accelerate it. The more people who know what oil companies have done, the greater public anger against them will be, and the harder it will be for them to defend themselves. The more toxic their image, the harder making business deals, new pipelines and influencing government policy will become for the Oil Companies.

We coordinate attack lines that we post and share online in an attempt to go viral. Facts are important, but we need to change people's minds too. Humour and outrage are the most effective tools for engagement, so we harness them in our attacks.

Last post we put forward attack ideas. The ideas that got the most upvotes were:

1. Find the top 100 CO2 producing companies. Ask each one of them publicly how much money it would take to get them to stop emitting CO2, under the pretext to get financing for the lowest offer with the highest impact. What we really achieve with this is to manifest the idea in peoples heads that those companies hold our future and wellbeing hostage, that we would have to buy us free, whilst giving them a list of specific enemies to project their anger at - credit to u/[Pherdl](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pherdl/)
2. Oil corporations take our tax money without our consent. Time for them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Stop subsidies for these welfare billionaires. - credit - u/[NikiLauda88](https://www.reddit.com/user/NikiLauda88/)

Both ideas are excellent. With idea 2, we just need to take the message and spread it. Copy it exactly or make your own variation. Back it up by linking to  this [article](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/fossil-fuel-subsidies-2022) showing fossil fuel subsidies reached an all time high of 7 trillion last year, which is madness.

With Idea 1, I think we need to focus on max 3 of the top polluting companies. I suggest Shell, BP and Exxon. I already posted it above, but here's the idea in action in an [attack against Shell](https://twitter.com/FrankKane80/status/1700885098738937995?s=20).

"148268","kqquaej",1,"Nice, I'm glad you're asking for help with motivation for action.

One way one can educate oneself on climate change is by reading information online or in print, listening to others either online or, for example, in seminar, and by speaking with others who know more than oneself about the circumstance in general or about specific aspects of the circumstance.

I personally advise (beware, also I am naive) that two ways which may be the most useful for a young person to introduce themselves to the matter for getting involved are (1) reading online from high-quality sources and (2) speaking personally with expert officials for further guidance.

Here is some general information for getting started on these two paths:

(1)
Reading online.
One can familiarize oneself with the different types of published materials and different types of sources who publish materials so to select high-quality information to learn from.
University libraries provide free such guides online for oreinting oneself to (1) searching for and finding the information one seeks and (2) discerning whether the value of the information one finds is worth more than the effort digesting it for one's goals. One can find guides through exploring university library websites (any library, think Harvard, MIT, UCLA, your local library) or call the library and ask to be connected with a ""subject specialist"" librarian who would be most appropriate for helping you with climate change personal research and learning. ('Hi, I'm ___, I am figuring out how to ___, I call to revieve help with [specific aim they may be able to help you with].') Part of the job of the subject specialist librarian is to help people do exactly this, learn about resources, get started on finding their own resources, and learn how to read through material. Some libraries may restrict such resources to matriculated students.
Learning to search the web, find, and organize one's own information, and, especially, to think critically about ANY kind of information one finds will help one learn about what can be done (as well as what the situation is).

For the case your parents would pay for a subscription:
https://www.nature.com/briefing/anthropocene
The email newsletter is free, the nature articles linked to from the newsletter are not (also linked to are free, non-nature articles.)

This may be more of what you have in mind in posting:
https://www.ucsusa.org/climate

(2)
Speaking with experts
I'm less immediately prepared to offer a path forward for finding people to speak with.
I have in mind, vaguely, that people who hold official roles—presidents of clubs, lawyers, congress people, science outreach advocates, academics giving action-focused talks, liaisons for philanthropic organizations, research/project grant officials or secretaries, your parents' friends who happen to know about such matters, college students with similar interests—or are somehow active in climate change projects or sectors of the economy relevant for climate change solutions are, some proportion of them, likely to help a young person with their motivations for getting involved in climate change solution projects, especially if those motivations are expressed clearly and specifically. You can not know exactly what you need while knowing specifically what you want.

Similar introduction as calling the library: 'Hi, I'm [name]. I seek [aim]. Have you [e.g. 'the time and interest to speak with me for 15min/30min/1hr about the organization of effort toward climate change solutions in your occupational sector?'].'

Practicing communicating succinctly, respectfully, and with independent direction is an excellent practice, one's strength of which substantially influences the outcome of such ""cold"" (without prior acquaintence) conversations.

More specifically, a world government that is a federal global government that has jurisdiction exclusively over world crises, climate change, military issues, citizenship (allowing for United Nations Citizenship, meaning the right to live and work anywhere in the world, and national citizenship, giving you the right to vote in national elections and run for office in national elections (if in democratic country), granted by having a residence in a residence in a country for two years and, if you have more than one residence in multiple countries, you will have both countries citizenship if you owned the residence for at least two years and can prove that you have paid taxes to each country \[people without a residence would have the national citizenship of their last residence\] pandemics, border disputes between countries, internet jurisdiction, international commerce, defined specifically as someone who crosses a national line and what they do while they travel to their final destination, and an object that is traveled across a national line under the same circumstances as a person, space jurisdiction (until other planets potentially create their own world governments), and scientific discoveries relating to weapons that can cause mass destruction. Everything else would be under the jurisdiction of the nations states and their respective regional states/provinces.

The reason I believe this is the solution to climate change is because I do not believe that countries like the US are willing to take enough action on climate change to truly fix the issue. If we have a federal world government, preferably under the UN, as it is an already existing global institution, it would be able to solve the climate problem, as it will be able to implement solutions all throughout the world.

For my call to action, I recommend that you write to your local countries's lawmakers and ask them to get a World Constitutional Convention started, specifically, next year at the UN Summit of the Future, as they are planning on strengthening global governance at that event. I have also created a petition that you can sign (although I posted that on another subreddit, so I will not post it, but it is on [change.org](https://change.org)).

If people take those actions, I believe that we can solve the climate crisis.","Call for World Government as Solution for Climate Change",0.36,0,0,"2023-10-18 22:36:04"

Tourists from the holiday park use them, and I’ve seen a lot of them use the scooters to get to the nearby supermarket to grab food for the stay - I used to work on site and you’d be shocked at how many people would use a car for that same trip even just to buy a couple bags of shopping. 

Sure average local pedestrians are probably using them too but it’s silly to insinuate cyclists are not choosing their bike which is free to use over a scooter they need to pay for and have limitations with.

What it boils down to is that people aren’t always going to be using them as a replacement for a car journey, it’s inevitable that some people are just going to use them for the novelty and will potentially ride like an idiot, but taking the option away from those who use them in place of a car based on this completely defeats the point of giving people an alternative to driving.

This paper importantly confirms the recent work and letters of James Hansen and his research team.

New paper press release:
Cleanup of air pollution heats the Earth
https://cicero.oslo.no/en/articles/cleanup-of-air-pollution-heats-the-earth

“Recent reductions in emissions of tiny particles, the major cause of air pollution globally, have led to more heat in the Earth’s climate system. This is shown in a new international study led by CICERO and published in Nature Communications Earth &amp; Environment.”

“Satellite measurements clearly show that more heat is entering the Earth’s atmosphere from the Sun compared to the amount of terrestrial energy escaping to space. This so-called Earth energy imbalance leads to accumulation of heat and warming of the Earth’s surface.

It is well known that man-made emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases have been the major cause of global warming in recent decades, and that emissions of particles have masked part of this warming. Most of the particles, especially sulphate, reflect sunlight and therefore act to cool the planet. In the last couple of decades, however, this cooling effect has reversed and now contributes to a warming due to extensive measures to improve air quality in many regions worldwide.”

Peer-reviewed scientific paper:
Recent reductions in aerosol emissions have increased Earth’s energy imbalance
https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01324-8.pdf


“Abstract

The Earth’s energy imbalance is the net radiative flux at the top-of-atmosphere. Climate model simulations suggest that the observed positive imbalance trend in the previous two decades is inconsistent with internal variability alone and caused by anthropogenic forcing and the resulting climate system response. Here, we investigate anthropogenic contributions to the imbalance trend using climate models forced with observed sea-surface temperatures. We find that the effective radiative forcing due to anthropogenic aerosol emission reductions has led to a 0.2 ± 0.1 W m−2 decade−1 strengthening of the 2001–2019 imbalance trend. The multi-model ensemble reproduces the observed imbalance trend of 0.47 ± 0.17 W m−2 decade−1 but with 10-40% underestimation. With most future scenarios showing further rapid reductions of aerosol emissions due to air quality legislation, such emission reductions may continue to strengthen Earth’s energy imbalance, on top of the greenhouse gas contribution. Consequently, we may expect an accelerated surface temperature warming in this decade.”

Though I think the intent is relatively good (better than the status quo), even I thought the presentation was quite cringe. There are some real issues that make it not as good as it sounds, though:

1. Nothing Apple makes is really a necessity, so the even carbon neutrality is still just harm reduction, its not a trade-off between carbon cost and utility (like, carbon-intense agriculture, or transportation, or carbon-intense production of carbon-neutral energy infrastructure for example).
2. They claim that the offices are carbon-neutral, but they are all in parking craters, encouraging terrible land use; and from my personal experience, half of Apple office workers drive giant trucks (to cosplay as construction workers, or something).

Marine organisms are simultaneously exposed to anthropogenic stressors associated with ocean acidification and ocean warming, with expected interactive effects. Species from different trophic levels with dissimilar characteristics and evolutionary histories are likely to respond differently. Here, we perform a meta-analysis of controlled experiments including both ocean acidification and ocean warming factors to investigate single and interactive effects of these stressors on marine species. Contrary to expectations, we find that synergistic interactions are less common (16%) than additive (40%) and antagonistic (44%) interactions overall and their proportion decreases with increasing trophic level. Predators are the most tolerant trophic level to both individual and combined effects. For interactive effects, calcifying and non-calcifying species show similar patterns. We also identify climate region-specific patterns, with interactive effects ranging from synergistic in temperate regions to compensatory in subtropical regions, to positive in tropical regions. Our findings improve understanding of how ocean warming, and acidification affect marine trophic levels and highlight the need for deeper consideration of multiple stressors in conservation efforts.""","science","2024-04-23 03:33:50","1cauptv","screendoorblinds",0,1,0,"True","2016-03-20 19:37:35",20,0,202,4946,5168,4,"","Responses of marine trophic levels to the combined effects of ocean acidification and warming",1,4,0,"2024-04-23 03:33:20"

"434125","jjg4bsp",1,"All of that is addressed, you just havent even read the links and appear utterly unfamiliar with basic biology.

1) 

Cows emit astronomical amounts of methane (emissions: climate change), and manure (eutrophication emissions) no matter what they are fed because thats their biology. ""Organic"" doesnt mean anything.  There simply is no magic that can undo or erase their physiology im truly sorry to tell you. Cows are ruminants that ferment, poop and fart a lot, ok buddy?

2) 

You cant have beef production on ""existing pasture"" as demand for meat is growing due to both population growth and economic development outside developed countries. This is obvious as is but it clearly needs to be pointed out.

And with meat production (esp Bovid meat), we cannot feed the world because there is not enough land, whatever form of beef production is used. With current trends we would need 4 earths or more to feed the world using current diets.
Plus, raising cattle just worsens climate change due to its massive emissions, which will accelerate the collapse in food production, and pollutes water resources.

Yet, because directly eating plants directly represents a jump of only one trophic level, instead of two like beef (see ecological efficiency ten percent law link), the respource use efficiency is off the charts higher compared to beef. This automatically leads to less land use change, less pesticides (as well as no farts, poop, or the damage those cause), since much less plants need to be grown, on a smaller area, than when those plants are fed to cattle raised for humans.

because of this higher efficiency of resource (land, water, nutrients, etc,) use, replacing beef production with protein rich plant production would reduce the necessary amount of agricultural land drastically, generally estimated at ~75%. This land could then be reforested and turned into carbon sinks, and habitats for wildlife.

For anything else, i really cant help you, it really is just basic biology and basic thermodynamics.
I suggest you inform yourself and let yourself process this over time, you are clearly experiencing heaps of cognitive dissonance right now, and thats your responsibility to deal with, not mine.

No matter the rainfall amount, the 1 hour fuels, grasses and weeds, will always dry out and catch fire from roadside debris or other incidents. The point to note is the 13 atmospheric rivers in 2023, kept the vast majority of wildland starts to grass fires only. California residents owe a big thanks to Governor Newsom who has greatly expanded the resources of Cal Fire,  with dozens of new aircraft, hundreds of new stations, and thousands of new engines, and firefighters. Cal Fire is recognized among peers  as the finest wildland firefighting department in the world, thanks to the State which provides generous funding, and a strong Union,  that attracts top talent.","science","2024-02-06 17:49:09","1aker1u","Wissotafarms",0,4,0,"True","2023-09-25 03:57:21",0,0,1,4928,4929,66,"","Column: Hate the storm?

Because one of the things 2020 proved (avoiding the words that trigger the automod) is that a significant number of Americans will always fight against measures put in place to save them from the consequences of their actions.  They were willing to fight against those measures at the cost of their lives, sacrificed in the very short term.

One of the things that sometimes gets lost in r/climate is the bigger picture, the environment as a whole and the demands that we, as a country and as a world, place on it for resources.  It's fair to say, I think, that every dollar spent (or dollar equivalent) comes with a cost to the environment.  Whether that cost is emissions, or resource depletion, or deforestation, or habitat destruction, or visible pollution, or any of a host of other consequences, there is *always* a cost to the environment when people spend money.

To me, it's why this single statistic is so meaningful, consumer spending by country.

[~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_largest\_consumer\_markets~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_consumer_markets)

America's population of 330 million doesn't just lead the world, it leads it by an enormous margin.  Our consumer spending is roughly equivalent to that of the European Union (448 million), China (1.4 billion), India (1.4 billion), and Japan (125 million).  It takes 30 countries (because there are 27 countries currently in the EU) and 3.373 billion people *combined* to equal the spending of US consumers.

&gt; Researchers from the University of Birmingham have developed an innovative method for existing furnaces that could reduce steelmaking&amp;#039;s CO2 emission by nearly 90%. The iron and steel industry is a major cause of greenhouse gasses, accounting for 9% of global emissions.

&gt; In blast furnace steel manufacturing, coke is used to produce metallic iron from ore obtained from mining - which releases large quantities of carbon dioxide in the process.

&gt; According to Dr Harriet Kildahl, who co-devised the method with Professor Yulong Ding, their technology aims to convert this carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide that can be reused in the iron ore reaction.

"138514","krme2cm",1,"&gt;Earlier this month, our news feed was filled with stories about climate scientist Michael Mann winning a protracted legal battle against his right-wing, anti-science defamers. At a time when doomscrolling is common and the world can feel grim, it’s heartening to see a victory in the fight against disinformation and attacks on science and scientists.

&gt;Cases involving attacks on climate scientists are why our organization exists. CSLDF was founded in 2011 to help defend Mann in a different lawsuit, when right-wing politicians combined forces with a coal-funded ‘advocacy’ group to attempt to investigate his work via official channels and then as a ‘citizen demand.’ While we were not directly involved in the recent defamation case, we provided legal assistance to over 50 researchers last year and similar numbers in preceding years.

&gt;Although analogous to many others, Dr. Mann’s case is unique. Most notably, many researchers are not willing or able to fight back like this, even when facing vicious and unfounded attacks just for doing their jobs. Fear of professional reprisal, fear for their safety, lack of financial or legal resources, and other concerns prevent scientists from speaking out.

&gt;We hope, however, that this case will serve as a reminder that the truth still matters. At a time when norms are being upended and long-standing scientific facts are being ignored altogether, it is gratifying to know that a jury of our peers can hear the facts and come out in support of science and basic decency.

&gt;We at CSLDF are also heartened that the expertise and support that we and other legal experts provide can make a real impact on the ongoing war on science. As Dr. Mann and Peter Fontaine, an  environmental lawyer and co-counsel in Mann’s defense, wrote in a recent op-ed,

If you can get paid ""hard cash"" (i.e no tax cuts etc but real money) to *filter air*, you've literally (well, figuratively literally 🤣) built a gold mine and that would start a rush to mine this gold (actual literal air!) the likes of which mankind has never seen and would liken the California gold rush to a picnic in the park.

However that money needs to come from carbon as you said so you don't pay people to pollute and clean it up. You should pay more to pollute than you get from cleaning up but still get paid a lot to clean up. Which is why the tax needs to be significant and the tech mature enough to be cheap.

Cleaning up after yourself should lower your costs.

Cleaning up after someone else should be profitable.

Not releasing carbon in the first place should also be more profitable than releasing it to be cleaned up.

All that easy money is bound to attract dishonest people so it's important to have strict regulations in place though.

""Modelled dietary scenarios often fail to reflect true dietary practice and do not account for variation in the environmental burden of food due to sourcing and production methods. Here we link dietary data from a sample of 55,504 vegans, vegetarians, fish-eaters and meat-eaters with food-level data on greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, eutrophication risk and potential biodiversity loss from a review of 570 life-cycle assessments covering more than 38,000 farms in 119 countries. Our results include the variation in food production and sourcing that is observed in the review of life-cycle assessments. All environmental indicators showed a positive association with amounts of animal-based food consumed. Dietary impacts of vegans were 25.1% (95% uncertainty interval, 15.1–37.0%) of high meat-eaters (≥100 g total meat consumed per day) for greenhouse gas emissions, 25.1% (7.1–44.5%) for land use, 46.4% (21.0–81.0%) for water use, 27.0% (19.4–40.4%) for eutrophication and 34.3% (12.0–65.3%) for biodiversity. At least 30% differences were found between low and high meat-eaters for most indicators. Despite substantial variation due to where and how food is produced, the relationship between environmental impact and animal-based food consumption is clear and should prompt the reduction of the latter.""

However, despite the problem’s urgency, addressing climate is easier said than done. The world will continue to heat up unless we make it easier to take massive, widespread, and meaningful Climate Action. That’s why, as part of my work as Executive Director at the Climate Action Center at PUCV university in Chile, I’ve reflected on the top barriers to climate action, so we can map out where to focus and potential solutions to overcome these hurdles.

So, here are the top 10 barriers to climate action:

## 🚫💰 Barrier # 1. Lack of funding.

Without the necessary financial support, it’s challenging to implement the solutions we need to combat climate change.

There is a massive disconnect between the economy and environmental impact.

## 🌎🤔 Barrier # 2. Earth Illiteracy

Most of the world does not even know what’s going on with the planet.

Many people sense that something is very wrong, but they may not have the critical thinking skills or scientific knowledge to understand the issue fully.

## 📚🌡️Barrier # 3. Climate Action Illiteracy

It’s not just about understanding the science behind climate change.

We also need to be aware of practical solutions to help us take action in our daily lives and reduce our carbon footprint.

Take for instance, food banking. Few people know that by donating excess food to those in need, we can help reduce food waste and thus methane, a potent greenhouse gas. At the same time, food banking helps address food insecurity and ensures that more people have access to food.

## 🧑‍💻💪 Barrier # 4. Insufficient Use of Skills for action

All skills are valuable during climate emergency.

There needs to be more knowledge on how to repurpose and re-package skills for climate action. We need to help people to get more people into climate-related jobs.

As the world in the verge of massive realization that we need to decarbonize all our economy urgently, more and more climate organizations are created, so some skills that will be increasingly valuable are :

• hiring

• recruiting

• managing

Even seemingly unrelated skills, such as storytelling, are urgently needed to address the climate crisis and promote climate action. In fact, storytelling has become increasingly relevant in today’s world as we strive to communicate the urgency and risk of the issue, and inspire action.

## 🏛️🤷‍♀️ Barrier # 5. Policy Inertia

AKA: Inability to Influence Public Policy.

People often feel frustrated and powerless in their ability to influence public policy, resulting in a lack of political will to take meaningful climate action.

It’s paradoxical that this problem persists in a world where our representatives are just an email or tweet away. However, in the age of fake news and social media bots, it’s become increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction and to hold our leaders accountable.

## 💻🔍Barrier # 6.Insufficient Digital Literacy

Very related to the inability to influence public policy.

With the growing importance of technology and digital tools in today’s world, it’s crucial to understand how these tools can support and enhance climate action efforts. However, many people lack the digital literacy skills needed to use technology for this purpose effectively.

Examples are climate DAOs and social media campaigns.

Digital skills even include ultra-working productivity tips to have two or three climate jobs in the time it takes to have one.

## 🤝👥 Barrier # 7. Poor Community Organization

Climate organizations require efficient coordination, administration, and paperwork.

Therefore, the lack of organization and communication within communities results in ineffective and disjointed efforts to combat climate change.

## 🌪️🔥 Barrier # 8. Inadequate Disaster Preparedness

AKA: Insufficient Climate Resilience

There is a lack of planning and preparation to avoid certain climate change-related disasters, resulting in damage that can be avoided.

Think, for example, Wildfires in Chile

## 🚒🔥Barrier # 9. Poor Crisis Management

Effective crisis management is essential to adequately respond to the impact of climate change.

Individuals and institutions lack the skills and knowledge to respond effectively to climate-related crises, such as wildfires or extreme weather events.

## 😟💔 Barrier # 10 .Climate Anxiety

Climate change is not just an environmental issue — it’s also a psychological one.

Watching the news and experiencing climate disasters generate an increasing stress and trauma. So, it’s reasonable for individuals to disengage from these emotions and numb their feelings instead of pursuing climate action efforts. Pushing for change requires lots of courage when you believe everything is lost.

Practices like group meditation can help, as well as building resilience and coping skills, promoting mental health and well-being, and creating safe spaces for people to discuss their feelings and concerns.

## In Conclusion

Shedding some light on some of the most significant barriers to climate action and how we can work to overcome them is the first step to working on solutions. Having a list is a great start so we can work on systems thinking.

Together, we can make a difference and protect our planet.

I hope the rant was worth it, lolience, etc. I got the idea that everything was connected, yadda,  yadda, yadda.  I also grew up with a heavy influence from Native American culture surrounding wildlife due to my family. But when I had this experience under the guise of a psychedelic (psilocybin), my increase in empathy for nature was at levels that are hard to put into perspective. To put a name to it, yes, I did feel Gaia, Mother Earth, whatever you want to call it. There was a profound realization of that presence, of that connection, of that reality that every time I step outside of the house, I leave a trace, good or bad. 

Those experiences have worked well with the absurdist philosophy that I have found helpful in mitigating grief surrounding things we essentially have little control of. I realize, and almost hope (that's the stoic in me) that life will continue to get harder. It's in the realization that it's all made up and none of this really matters is where the true strength comes through. Why live a life of despair, anxiety, and depression when ultimately, I can take this time I'm given to pursue hobbies that give me a sense of purpose while also trying to take care of my immediate surroundings as best as possible.

Picture me, M17, wanting desperately to get involved in climate action and to actually be on the right side of history, feeling like I can’t enjoy my holiday in Italy because all the bad news about the climate is messing me up mentally. I’m reminded of it daily with the blistering heatwave, and i really dont want to turn my back on climate action while i’m here. I feel like if I relax here, on holiday, i’m being temporarily yet mortally complicit, and I don’t forgive myself. This is completely messing me up…


My question is, well there are two questions

A) Is this true? Am I being mortally and selfishly complicit here if I take my mind off it?

B) What the hell can I do while i’m here?

C) How else can I get involved? I’m very anxious about direct action, but i’m a keen singer, I find writing speeches natural, and i’m known to my local representative as he’s given me tickets to parliament several times, I can and have raised it with them

Given the warming rate of 0.2C per decade since 1970, and the fact that a super El Nino event can add up to 0.2C to a specific year’s global temperatures through natural variability, it is possible for us to see a single year exceeding 1.5C a full decade before the long-term average warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases does.Because of this, we should be a bit cautious about how we interpret the first year passing 1.5C (whether it happens in 2023, 2024, or later)!

This obviously relates to [the other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/xfo099/what_are_the_most_visceral_climate_scenarios_or/) we're discussing u/Duende555, and where that research points my mind is —

*For any of the information/data that might be persuasive to somebody, I wonder if there is a story / personal experience that could help bridge the divide?*

For example: ""In the Pacific Northwest, almost 10% of houses are predicted to be affected by wildfires in the next 30 years — and flood levels are predicted to rise by half a foot"" *—&gt;* ""I know a person who lived through the heatdome in the Pacific Northwest.  It was hard for them to go outside.  It was hard for them to breathe.  And then, when that was finally over, the floods came.  It overwhelmed their water treatment plants.  The sewage spilled out into the floods, their untreated sewage flowing all across the town.  The stench was horrific.  And the fish and animals started popping up in the floods, dead from all of it.  It took down their bridges going out of town.  So they couldn't go anywhere.  They just had to stay and try to survive.

This is happening despite being three years away from the existing agreement expiring (expiration in 2026) and before the city completes its Climate Action and Adaptation Plan Process (due on March 2023). This is important because electricity generation is responsible for over half of the greenhouse gas emissions from the city (responsible for 10 Megatons of carbon dioxide emitted in 2020). Franchise agreement negotiations are the single biggest opportunity for the city to curb its largest source of emissions. 

Media attention is focused on the issue of under-grounding of transmission lines near historic neighborhoods and the university. A lot of focus is on leveraging the negotiations to create a source of funding to pay for under-grounding. 

Climate needs to be a primary concern through this process. How can citizens act to ensure that the city maximizes reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and increases renewable adoption?

A bit of background for those of you who might not be aware, the data centers we're all using right now (we're on Reddit, after all) consume a lot of power and generate a lot of carbon--estimated to be on par with the entire aviation industry. With the recent popularity of AI and HPC (high-performance computing, what was traditionally known as supercomputing), data centers are naturally using more power and pumping out more carbon. That's something we cannot rewind the clock on, the genie is out of the bottle. But we can use other high-tech inventions to balance things out.

What the server company I work for is doing is offering our clients new ways to cool their data centers/ servers with the minimum amount of power necessary. There's an index we use in the industry called PUE, or power usage effectiveness. PUE equals overall data center power consumption divided by the power requirement of the processors. In simpler terms, it measures how much additonal power you're using to cool your servers and maintain stable operations. The ideal PUE is 1.0: that is, zero additional power is used to cool the servers. But currently the industry average is around 1.6. This means **60% more** power is used just to run the air conditioning for the servers.

We're trying to change the way the IT sector thinks about thermal management by introducing liquid cooling and immersion cooling solutions, which are more energy-efficient than air cooling. We're not the only ones doing this but we already have sucess stories with the [Japanese telecom giant KDDI](https://www.gigabyte.com/Article/japanese-telco-leader-kddi-invents-immersion-cooling-small-data-center-with-gigabyte?lan=en) and a [major Taiwanese semiconductor company](https://www.gigabyte.com/Article/semiconductor-giant-selects-gigabyte-s-two-phase-immersion-cooling-solution?lan=en). We're helping our customers use liquid coolant to cool their servers, either by running the coolant through tubes into the servers (conventional DLC liquid cooling) or dunking the servers directly into a coolant bath (immersion cooling).

The benefits are twofold. First, liquid/immersion cooling consumes much less power than air conditioning, so we can help our clients improve PUE from the industry average of 1.6 to as low as **1.02** (just 2% more power to cool the servers instead of 60% more power). Second, chips cooled in this fashion can reach a higher TDP ceiling, which means they can achieve max performance without needing to be throttled to prevent overheating. If every chip is giving you max performance, you need fewer chips overall, so your carbon footprint is reduced further.

So for those of you who might be worried about what big tech is doing to balance their carbon emissions, there *is* a solution, it just takes time for this new technology to be more widely adopted. From our case studies you can see that some big global companies are already setting an example for everyone else. You can learn more about effective cooling technologies here ([link](https://www.gigabyte.com/Topics/Advanced-Cooling?lan=en)) if you like. In the immortal words for Douglas Adams, don't panic!

"433533","jnpgc5z",1,"At my Highschool, there are a few kids advocating for a carbon tax in my state. It got me curious and I read a senate bill from 2021. It’s gotten me a bit confused. It seems like they’ll be taxing distributors, and then using that money to reduce utility bills which seems kind of redundant to me, apart from the fact that they’ll be siphoning 10% from that cycle to use on a general fund for promoting renewable resources. 

Is this really beneficial? I suppose I understand how the 10% is going towards fighting against carbon emissions. However, I feel like taking money from distributors so that they end up raising bills and then giving back that money to consumers to reduce these raised bills is kind of silly. I also don’t see how this won’t screw over low income people who may not have access to alternatives and who’s money would end up benefitting someone else’s utility bill more than it would be promoting renewable resources.

I read somewhere that it’s supposed to make these industries more conscious about emissions since they’ve got this extra cost, but what’s stopping them from just passing it onto the consumer? And then it goes back to my question of how it will have any positive impact unless you’re rich enough to afford low emission options and poor enough to actually be concerned about saving money on utilities?

Hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are the only credible options for new aviation fuels in foreseeable future.

SAFs are an offset scheme where emissions from hydrocarbon combustion at altitude are offset by carbon capture during production of the fuel.

Biofuel SAFs have low carbon capture efficiency and require vast biomass areas with negative environmental externalities.

Power-to-Liquid (PTL, aka E-Fuel or SynFuel) SAFs use direct air capture to capture carbon during the production process. On this infographic, net-zero-carbon PTL SAF is compared to true-zero- carbon green liquid hydrogen.

Those in power will have extensively modelled the consequences of climate collapse and must know that global food systems are in imminent danger of collapse, that economies will likewise collapse and that billions of people will become migrants as a result, trying to move away from the sacrifice zones to (what they see as) more liveable parts of the globe. Once all that shit hits the fan, it is survival of the fittest.

So much right-wing policy and rhetoric from Western governments and media, as well as the widespread militarisation of police, seems geared precisely to 'manage' these scenarios. Have those in charge made the calculation that the only hope for humanity is a massive population decrease (hence letting Covid rip and allowing the collapse of the systems which feed the world)?

The billionaires (let's call them that - I mean the rich people with the global power who know what's coming and are 'super-prepping') want to be in charge of who survives. These elites would want to keep up the pretence that everything is fine as long as possible giving them longer to prep and accumulate even more power and wealth to 'ride the storm.' To do that, they need people to keep consuming, driving cars, staying distracted by shopping, celebs, sport, war etc as long as possible (remember, positive change doesn't matter under this scenario, it's too late for substantive change now anyway in this calculation).

These elites would figure on a period of terrible turmoil as populations finally realise it is too late and huge swathes of people understand that they are going to starve to death. If the elites can ride out that storm (with their bunkers and arsenals of weapons), they get to inherit the globe with a much smaller, more manageable population of 500 million or so.

That population could then be returned to a feudal system with the overlords (or their descendants) equipped with the kind of tech which will see them stabilise the living remnant of the planet (populations concentrated away from the equator), develop clean energy and promote nature's recovery as much as possible in a bid to create a society most people now would view as fascist, but those in charge would no doubt view as a utopia.

Maybe that's a dark vision, but I don't really see what other explanation there can be for the headlong charge off the climate cliff, other than it is a desperate last deliberate roll of the dice by those with the power and wealth to make the decision. Under this nightmare scenario, the quicker the collapse occurs, the better. The immediate benefit for these elites is that they get to live in relative luxury for the rest of their lives behind their defensive walls with their stockpiles of stash. The longer term benefit, if they care at all, is that they hope their descendants become the new ruling elites who inherit the earth and lionise their billionaire ancestors as the saviours of humanity through their sanitised history books.

News report on new findings:
https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/future-floods-global-warming-intensifies-heavy-rain-2013-even-more-than-expected

Link to peer-reviewed open source science paper:
https://www.pik-potsdam.de/~anders/publications/kotz_lange23.pdf

The key findings are as follows:

1) Intensification and increase in number of torrential rain extreme weather events will be worst in tropical regions and in high latitude polar regions

2) Ensemble of 21 climate models (collectively called CMIP-6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Version 6 - the latest) expects intensification of extreme rainfall events by an average of 6.1% per degree C of global warming. Clausius-Clapeyron Theory (hot air holds more water) is about 7% per degree C temperature increase.

Observations show the historical increase thus far is about 8% to 8.4% increase in intensification per degree C of global warming. Thus, models are way too low (too conservative).

3) Ensemble of 21 climate models (collectively called CMIP-6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Version 6 - the latest) expects frequency of occurrence of extreme rainfall events to increase by an average of 12.1% per degree C of global warming. Clausius-Clapeyron Theory (hot air holds more water) is about 11.7% increase in frequency of extreme rainfall events per degree C temperature increase.

Observations show the historical increase in the frequency of occurrence of extreme rainfall events thus far is between an 18% and 32% increase in occurrence frequency per degree C of global warming. Thus, models are way too low (too conservative). Even worse for frequency of occurrence as compared to intensification.

We are in for a heap of trouble in our climate casino.

I am not surprised that historical observations of intensification and frequency of occurrence of observed extreme precipitation events are much higher than the models, which are close to the thermodynamic theory (Clausius-Clapeyron equation). The slowing and increased waviness of the jet stream in combination with the intensification and increased frequency effects, as well as the destabilization of our atmosphere (covered in last video) are all wreaking havoc on the weather we are experiencing. 

Basically, climate caused weather extremes are crushing us like bugs, and will soon collapse our global food supply.

Climate scientists and organizers have been sounding the alarm on the climate crisis for years. The latest findings from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tell us that regardless of what we do now, temperatures will still rise globally.

But, we still have time to mitigate damage to our most vulnerable communities by using the full power of the government to tackle the climate crisis head on. Fossil fuel CEOs are set to make near-historic profits this year, while working people have been navigating everyday life between a deadly pandemic—made worse by the Trump administration—unemployment and the worst effects of this crisis, from a record-breaking wildfire and hurricane season.

Scientists have told us exactly what we need to do to mitigate this crisis, but will we listen and respond?

Fusion requires extremely high heat and high pressure. There are several ways to do that in a reactor, some which involved lasers, others involve magnetic pressure. 

Regardless, these machines are building sized reactors. It has to be in order to force a D - T reaction in any “pure” way. The energy necessary it ignite a chain reaction requires a huge input of power and much of the size comes from the need to store the energy for ignition. 

In a bomb, the trigger is a fission explosion. Fissile material is the only compact and transportable way to build a nuke small enough to fit inside a missile or bomb warhead. 

There is one theoretical way to get a “purer” reaction using antimatter. But we have no way to making enough of it at scale and no way of safely containing it in a moving object that doesn’t risk blowing the whole thing early. 

If we were to figure both of those out, we wouldn’t need the fusion component to begin with.

"3438","l1yoacl",6,"Hey all, I hope you'll read my latest L.A. Times column and let me know what you think! Here's how it starts:

&gt;*I never saw the 2017 film “Justice League.” But if I had, I would have been treated to a scene in which Batman (Ben Affleck) tries to persuade Aquaman, Protector of the Oceans (Jason Momoa) to join his band of superheroes by referencing the climate crisis.*

&gt;*“Mankind’s melting the polar ice caps, destroying the ecosystem,” Batman warns.*

&gt;*“Hey, I don’t mind if the oceans rise,” Aquaman responds.*

&gt;*“How about if they boil?” Batman asks ominously.*

&gt;*That scene is a great example of how Hollywood movie and TV studios can keep climate change and clean energy solutions top of mind for audiences — and thus motivate people to take action — while also telling entertaining stories, according to a new report from Colby College’s Buck Lab for Climate and Environment and the nonprofit consulting firm Good Energy.*

&gt;*The report — shared with The Times ahead of its release Tuesday — examined 250 of the most popular films of the last decade, based on quantity of IMDb ratings. Researchers at Maine’s Colby and the University of Utah applied the newly developed Climate Reality Check — which measures whether a film and its characters acknowledge the existence of global warming — to the most frequently rated fictional movies set in present-day or near-future Earth and released from 2013 through 2022.*

&gt;*One key finding: Just under 10% of the 250 movies passed the Climate Reality Check.*

&gt;*Is that a lot, or not very many?*

&gt;*Personally I was encouraged, especially after a previous USC analysis found that just 2.8% of scripted films and TV episodes from 2016 through 2020 included any mention of climate change, or a long list of related keywords. The number of movies passing the Climate Reality Check went up over time, from 5.6% during the first half of the decade to 13.6% during the second half.*

&gt;*Things are moving in the right direction. Still, there’s a lot of room for improvement.*

&gt;*“Given the stakes of the climate crisis, and the incredible urgency of this issue, it’s hard to say 10% is a positive number,” said Matthew Schneider-Mayerson, an English and environmental studies professor at Colby and the report’s lead author.*

\-------------------------------------------------

A Belgian band I occasionally pen songs for had one track that sounded so confessional, bittersweet and lush that I asked if I could write its lyrics. The words wrote themselves, given my recent history.

I was one of the organizers of the September 27th rally that shut down Montreal. The march drew over of half a million people on a Friday - the largest climate protest in history. City hall closed, as did every school commission and most downtown offices. Our campaign to have businesses close in solidarity (and to say as much in signs posted at the door weeks in advance) tipped the scale from ""oh, look, environmentalists protesting once again"" to ""everyone is going because this matters"". Shops, travel agencies, grocery stores all closed in solidarity for the march against the climate crisis. One car dealership not only shut down that day, but paid its employees to attend. Our messaging was that the problem is systemic: that you are not to blame for the plastic you use, the car you drive. It worked. As soon as people could see how this campaign could have an impact, they were all-in. Bankers, teachers, police officers. They showed what any parent craves: a means to the end we all need to reach. I could write a thesis on that day and the months that led up to it. I probably will. For now, there is this song. Because yes, the three years since that glorious Friday have been dispiriting. (As was the in-fighting and opportunism rife within the movement in the months prior to the march. Circular firing squad indeed).

As with all things climate, this song - which Marble Sounds perform beautifully IMO - won't likely get any traction, but as with all things climate, it was worth a try. More importantly, those lyrics were written and the video was made to tell you all that I see you. That I thank you.

"407604","k27b2xr",4,"&gt; Soren Brothers couldn’t shake off a recurring nightmare. Tornados and storms would lash against a bunker in which he was huddled, at the bottom of a stairwell. Outside, the scene was utter devastation: a climatic apocalypse, with the sky turning unearthly colours. Sometimes even the Grim Reaper would make a cameo. Then Brothers would wake up, aware that he had spent another night in a climate-disaster dream. “It was regular enough that it was a part of my life,” he says.
&gt; 
&gt; The nightmares used to haunt Brothers more often when he was a PhD student in Berlin studying the interactions between climate change and lakes. They had become less frequent—receding into memory, though still vivid—by the time he was announced, in November 2021, as the Royal Ontario Museum’s first curator of climate change. It’s a highly visible platform: located in Toronto, the ROM is one of the most visited museums in Canada. Brothers is the face of the museum’s efforts to insert climate change into more of its collection and public events. Yet, those expecting the museum to become an impassioned voice for greater climate action may initially be caught off guard. Much of Brothers’s focus is on the positive and not just the calamitous—on initiatives that are working—even if that’s not the tone some museum goers might expect. Where’s the rallying cry, they may ask. It shows the challenge the ROM and other museums face in finding the words to explain the science to a broad audience and to push for action while not disappointing those wanting to hear a more vociferous outcry.

&gt; Like other museums, the ROM is trying to straddle the call for action and the quieter world of peer-reviewed research. It’s a tricky balance.

This is particularly true in light of the current wildfires in Chile. While some individuals choose to disengage and numb themselves from the climate distress, only a few manage to turn their anguish into action or find a like-minded community to engage with.

However, the digital landscape offers unique opportunities for citizens and activists to expand their climate action even further.

Here are three frameworks that digital activists have embraced to maximize impact:

**🧠 Framework #1: Extended Cognition**

Digital activists view computers not just as tools to enhance their productivity.

They see their laptops as climate machines. With the power of AI, activists can leverage their abilities to manage multiple climate-related tasks and initiatives.

Some activists have even built themselves a “Second brain” using technology.

**📣 Framework #2: Amplifying the Message**

Expressing eco-anxiety is crucial for climate advocacy.

Digital activists message through multiple channels by writing one piece and publishing it with one click. Being consistent leads to a cumulative impact.

To avoid disaster, we must change minds first.

**👩‍💻️ Framework # 3. Online Communities**

Combining local and global work is a great activist combo.

The internet provides a decentralized platform for activists to collaborate and build communities around shared climate causes. The blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations, and online education communities are examples of ways that digital activists are leveraging technology to create impact at scale.

There is still much talk about climate work in the digital space, such as data-driven decision-making, climate modeling, and hacker groups.

The power of technology offers multiple possibilities to repurpose eco-anxiety and stop the climate crisis.

Time scales for these shifts can be one year to the next, or one month to another, or even shorter.

For example, one summer we can have torrential rains over the Mississippi River regions leading to record flood levels and disruption of shipping and breaches of flood walls leading to extensive regional flooding. The next summer, we then have record setting widespread drought, and river levels so low that the US Army Corps of Engineers blasts rocks on the river floor to keep some commercial barge traffic operating. The third year, we again have torrential rains leading to new record high river levels and massive flooding exceeding that of the previous record flooding. That’s weather whiplashing on a year-to-year timeframe.

Alternately, we can have a record heat wave in early Spring causing all the buds to come out on plants. Then, a record cold snap can occur, killing all the buds. Rinse and repeat.

These weather whiplashing events are very destructive and cause huge economic losses to societies, and they are occurring more and more often.

A few years ago, Jennifer Francis and her colleagues studied what they called Weather Whiplashing Events (WWEs) over North America.

In this new paper that I chat about, they examine WWEs spanning between Greenland, the North Atlantic Ocean, and Europe.

As global warming continues to accelerate, the scientific analysis clearly shows associated increases in frequency and severity of Weather Whiplashing Events.

I've dealt with serious eco-anxiety in the past, to the point of considering suicide a couple of times - but I've decided to put that feeling to one side and think to myself about what, realistically, I can do to make a difference to the problem.

A bit of info: I'm a white male in my late twenties, living in the UK and self-employed as a performer, writer and audio producer.

I think one of the hardest things about eco-anxiety is not quite knowing what to do about it. Most of the evidence I can see suggests that it is still PHYSICALLY possible to avert the worst of climate change, but that not enough is being done to move towards doing that. I haven't really done much in the way of direct action yet, but I've done my best to at least refrain from adding to the problem; I went vegan five years ago and stopped flying seven years ago - although sometimes I think all that achieves is avoidance of my own guilt, as I can't see that these decisions have practically changed anything on a wider scale. I'd like to change that, do something a bit more active to really make a difference.

I've been to a couple of meetings of groups like Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil and the like - but I'm not really sure which one to support, as they're all different from each other. I'm all for taking any action necessary, but it's hard to know in advance which forms of action will be effective. I look at so many different environmental charities and I sign petitions for them, but most of their campaign seems to involve getting people to donate. Again, I'll do that if it will help, but I wouldn't know which charity would be best to donate to, which aspects of the problem they'll most prioritise and which SHOULD be most prioritised - and I don't have much money, so I need to be careful with that kind of thing anyway.

Last question: how easy is it to also have a normal life whilst also being involved in this stuff? At the age I am, I want to make plans for my future, and it's so difficult! I know some people worry about whether or not to have children - that's not a major concern for me as I'm not really planning on having children anyway, even if there wasn't a climate crisis - but even just generally planning my career and my life generally is really hard in the current situation. How do people strike an activism/life balance?

What, realistically, can someone like me do? Where is the best place to concentrate my energy? I want to do something, but there's so much information in different areas I don't know what.","So, what's the plan? What can I do, realistically?",0.99,111,0,"2022-10-14 14:57:17"

Currently on list is:    


***Online databases/interactive maps***

* [ClimateJetsProject](https://climatejets.org/)\- An online database where visitors can see the climate emissions of owners of private jets around the world. Users will see the statistics- including how many flights using how many aircrafts, how much time + miles are spent flying and how much jet fuel used well as how much CO2 is emitted. Other information includes frequent destinations and international travel locations that private jet owners go to 
* [EJAtlas](https://ejatlas.org/) \- collects stories of communities struggling for environmental justice from around the world. It aims to make these mobilization more visible, highlight claims and testimonies and to make the case for true corporate and state accountability for the injustices inflicted through their activities. It also attempts to serve as a virtual space for those working on EJ issues to get information, find other groups working on related issues, and increase the visibility of environmental conflicts
* [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/) \- online platform that provides data and tools for monitoring forests. By harnessing cutting-edge technology, GFW allows anyone to access near real-time information about where and how forests are changing around the world.
* [Native Land Map](https://native-land.ca/) \- global map where users can type in their address, city or zipcode and find out what native land they are on. Users can also just scroll through the map and see what the various indigenous territories around the world are 
* [Open Climate](https://openclimate.network/) \- Allows users to navigate emissions inventories and climate pledges of different actors at every level, aggregating data from various public sources for countries, regions, cities and companies. Users can search for the country and region of their choosing, and see their carbon emmissions, the percentage of the worlds overall population that the country is responsible for and what their carbon pledges are.  Users can also look into climate impact + pledges of specifc companies. 
* [Tree Equity Score](https://treeequityscore.org/about/) \-  An online, visual, map database where visitors can input their city and then see how much treecover their neighborhood has compared to surrounding areas. Provides a number score from 0-100 
* [Audobon Society Native Plant Database](https://www.audubon.org/native-plants)\- Online database where visitors can input their zipcode and find what plants are native to their area if they wanted to start planting native plants. Focuses on native plants that are good for birds- but can be used for pollinators as well.

I am open to adding other sheets that cover other types of resources that I might not have here, I just haven't figured out what they should be yet.    
If you know of any or are working on any yourself that you think should be added to this list that were not mentioned above, please comment.

"433712","jmancdv",0,"&gt; OP asked questions and got answers from someone who is more informed than members of the general public.

Just because someone has more knowledge does not make him good at analysis or come to the right conclusions. Repeatedly we have seen scientists eating out of hands of big corporates for financial benefit. Even we, the common people, are the same. All of us are like YouTubers trying to solicit corporate support because that is the definition of success in today's world. That's also why climate crisis will not be resolved.

&gt; Sure, it’s good to be scared because it motivates us to take action, but it gets to the point where it’s paralyzing.

We are beyond being scared now. The scientific community is still very muted about the consequences of climate change. The problem is no one wants to appear politically incorrect. Only a few select media outlets have the courage to call a spade a spade. Economic growth and development, profit-oriented corporate philosophy, commercial farming, animal husbandry, modern medicine, aviation, real estate and emphasis on personal ambition as being a good thing will all have to be reversed. But who will say it loud and clear, who will bell the cat?

Again, that's also why climate crisis will not be resolved.

&gt; The way you worded this post sounds pretty hopeless- without hope, why even bother? Since we’re all doomed anyway…

I don't understand why most people want to emphasize on optimism and solutions when there are none. If we are drowning in the middle of the sea with no help from anywhere it's better to accept the truth than force yourself to have false hope. There is no point clutching at the straws when all evidence point to the single fact that we have to reverse our development, and do it fast. But no one is ready to do that.

Again, that's also why climate crisis will not be resolved.","action","2023-05-31 03:52:03","13dpv90","605_Home_Studio",0,0,0,"True","2021-10-25 16:59:37",0,0,48,4827,4875,153,"(For privacy reasons I'll not reveal specific details)

Things I got to know:- 

1. 1.5 C is possible but he doesn't see it happening. 2 C is increasingly likely now, post 2020 due to policy improvements, as per him.


2. The internal climate community is worrisd but has become more optimistic due to increased public awareness and better policy. He told me that just a few years ago, many clinate scientists broke down thinking about the future, now many of them are becoming more optimistic, cautiously though.


3.  I asked him about Solar Geo-engineering as I'm a proponent of it. He told me that while it's an uneasy topic, he thinks that we'll use it by mid 2030s, since there's a chance we may breach 1.5 C by then. I asked about consequences, he told me they're being studied, and can't be sure of them. (His expertise is not solar geo-engineering but he has a friend who is a researcher in the field.) 


4. Enhanced rock weathering is great, if done properly, and will probably be the biggest carbon sink if utilised correctly. However, it'll be needed to be subsidized quite heavily. 


5. I asked him about carbon capture and scale, he says that while it's probable that carbon capture will scale substantially, leaving the CO2 in the ground is the best way to remove CO2.


6. I asked him about feedbacks from the climate. He told me that they'll be minute compared to human emissions and humans emissions through and through are the main cause. He says that somethings happening faster than expected are worrying, but more worrying are human emissions.


7. I asked him how many people could suffer. There was an uneasy silence that followed. He said depends, but he said he couldn't be sure. 


8.  I asked him whether climate change is reversible? He said, some aspectssuch as heat and co2 in the atmosphere, are reversible and co2 won't take millennia as was considered the case, with innovation in the capture industry, however, sea level rise and ice sheets melting are things that will absolutely not reverse in our lifetimes.


9. I asked him if AI could help. He said he doesn't know, and wouldn't rely on just AI.


10. I asked him if we've made progress. He said absolutely. We've made good progress, but it should happen much much faster, and he couldn't stress enough on the faster, because that'll make things exponentially better. He said that he sees 2018 as a turning points where renewables and EVs really began being adopted.


11. I asked him about peak emissions. He said that 2025-2027 is most likely peak emissions. 


12. I asked him about RCPs and which one we'll follow, and he told me that he'd no attach any preference to any single RCP, but he does consider RCP 4.5 the upper limit, although that's uncertain given some conditions.


13. I asked whether we as individuals have an impact? He said not much, most pollution is in the hands of industries, the consumer, when in a collective group, can then only influence industry policies, as we've seen. He said protests and outcry is the biggest way we can have more influence. 


14. I asked him about meat, and he agreed that stopping meat would help stop substantial co2 emissions, however, that's still only a portion. Most meat emissions of co2 come from other sources, like logistics and etc. 


15. I asked him whether we, as the unknowing public should be optimistic? He said probably, but cautiously, he's told me that we should be excited about innovations but not be dependent on them, and that there's still a hard parh ahead. 


If you guys want me to ask him anything else, tell me in the comments, and I'll try.


Edit: About the meat part, he said most meat emissions come from other sources for example logistics, not just logistics itself. Most meat emissions from from farm/industrial methods. Meat is absolutely an issue and I apologise for the wording above which may have made it seem otherwise.

Advocacy is an integral part of activism. Yet some of us sometimes struggle to get our thoughts across to the people we want to communicate to. Slam poetry is an unique avenue of advocacy that combines performance with poetry, an avenue that we have not yet explored.

The people affected are diverse, and often forgotten as they are caught in the crossfire between economic progress and climate change. Embark on a voyage of advocating and spreading the message through slam poetry for those who have to pack up their entire lives and move elsewhere because of climatic reasons.

There’s no signing up required, so join spontaneously and add value to the session! Block it in your calendars 💫🗓️

It's not just about personal choice anymore; it's about the massive environmental impact of meat production. We're talking [deforestation](https://ourworldindata.org/deforestation), [mass extinctions](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/917471), [biosphere collapse](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/our-global-food-system-primary-driver-biodiversity-loss), huge [carbon emissions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352100490_Emissions_from_Animal_Agriculture-165_Is_the_New_Minimum_Figure), water [consumption](https://phys.org/news/2022-03-commentary-animal-agriculture-footprint-planet.html) and [pollution](https://blogs.ubc.ca/makingwaves/2017/02/07/cows-pigs-and-poultry-the-leading-cause-of-ocean-dead-zones/) – scorched earth for our descendants. 

And health-wise, there's plenty of evidence showing plant-based diets can be super beneficial. 

So, why stick with something that's clearly harming the planet and our health? Going no-meat isn't just some radical idea; it's [a necessary step](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/917471) if we really want to tackle these environmental issues head-on. It's not about forcing everyone overnight, but about starting a serious shift towards plant-based living.

If we did this (together with phasing out of fossil fuels), we could reforest those pastures, which are [the size of both Americas](https://assets.ourworldindata.org/uploads/2013/10/World-Map-by-Land-Use-01.png), and [store almost all carbon in them than has been released since the Industrial Revolution](https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000010), thus lowering atmospheric CO2 from 420ppm back to 280ppm. This would also help stop biodiversity loss and mass extinctions – just think about how many yet undiscovered medicines are in those living things we're going to lose for our love of steaks and dairy.

Having knowledge about [the collapse of the environment and our civilization](https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/) for 50 years and taking no meaningful action is what I would consider extreme.

The game itself is an adventure 3d side-scroller platformer, where you play as Cass a young arctic researcher. One day, the ice begins a rapid collapse, and you must get off the ice before it is too late. But not without gathering data about the climate and analyzing it!

In the game, you make your way through treacherous glaciers, you gather ice core samples, read surface temperatures, take satellite images, and even see narwhals.



To develop the game, we collaborated with several different groups of researchers. One of these is TiPES (https://www.tipes.dk/), a group of more than 18 universities that research tipping points and tipping elements in the Earth's climate. We also worked together with a group studying narwhals and their tusks (https://www.nordforsk.org/sv/projects/narwhal-tusks-tale-twist).



It was super interesting to work together with researchers to create the game. Some of the activities you do in the game, are based on some of the field work that researchers do in real life on the Arctic ice sheet.

A vehicle like that could replace the convenience of cars if we'd also coordinate to install park and rides with nice covered parking and bus lines running between them between cities.  Then lots of us could sell our cars and save lots of energy and money.  Then we could put all those savings to building to a new housing paradigm where we each have only a small but nice room and bathroom exclusively to ourselves and share other amenities, like kitchens, a lounge, a rooftop patio, whatever.  It could be really nice.  Then we could sell our homes and save lots of energy.  We'd also achieve higher density so we could probably then walk most places without even needing our spiffy micro mobility vehicles.  And while we're doing all that of course we'd be boycotting animal agriculture because animal ag and particularly factory farming is the commodification of life itself for selfish profits, and that'd be reason to boycott it alone even if it weren't the single most impactful thing most anyone could do right now without needing anyone's permissions to reduce their ecological footprint.

There, around a sun called Los, spins planet Htrae, a pleasantly warm green-blue planet upon which a race called namuhs has built a very impressive global civilization much like that of humans on far-away Earth – except, in subtle but significant ways, more ""advanced.""

Among namuhs on Htrae, the most popular reality TV shows feature humans on Earth, for the obvious reason that humans produce gripping drama as reliably as cows produce manure. Always among the most fanatically followed shows, their ratings have been especially high these last few hundred Earth years.

So when humans ravaged Earth with World Wars, the whole of Htrae swooned with concern.

When humans invented nuclear armaments, a vigorous public debate ensued on Htrae over the ethics of intervening to prevent disaster.

And as, year after year, humans utterly failed the challenge of anthropogenic global warming until it became a snowballing climate crisis, public opinion on Htrae snowballed into public pressure, until pressure tipped over into action.

The tipping point was Earth's brutal northern hemisphere summer of 2023. The minority belief that it would be unethical *not* to intervene became the majority consensus, and by far the most passionately held view.

So the Human Emergency Advisory Report Mission to Earth (HEAR ME) was commissioned under the command of Bob, a superstar among strategic anthropological engineers on Htrae.

During his intergalactic journey to Earth, Bob wrote important reminders on sticky notes and plastered them all around the inside of the command module.

On the wall in front of his favorite chair was one set:

* *Firmness w/o rigidity.*
* *Flexibility w/o squishiness.*
* *Robust immunity against takeover by the most malignant aspects of human potentiality.*
* *~~Here I sit, broken-hearted.~~*

A series of notes stuck across the top of the forward viewport (in which the Milky Way, then the Solar System, then Earth itself would grow larger upon approach):

* *IF hope isn't hopeless, it can be justified.*
* *IF hope can be justified, solutions are possible.*
* *IF solutions are possible, they can be found (a solution that can't be found is no solution).*
* *IF solutions can be found, they can be found by searching appropriately (""appropriate"": whatever works, not what doesn't).*
* *IF searching fails, it's inappropriate. To persist in inappropriate searching (expecting different results), is insane.*
* *Say: “You are looking under the lamp for something that isn't there, only because the light is there.”*

At last, Bob touched down in the middle of Kansas. It quickly became apparent that things on Earth were more perilously out of whack than anyone realized back home on Htrae. ""You’ve got yourself a world-class challenge – a real doozie,"" Bob said to himself. ""Hoo-*boy*!""

Then he set about studying humans more closely than any Namuh had previously been able, and began preparing his Report.

## by Bob

*Author's Note*:

*As I'm unfamiliar with human conventions for presenting Official Reports, I'll follow Namuhan conventions. Here are three worthy of special attention:*

1. *Namuhan Reports are customarily written in vigorous, pithy style. Out of respect for the Reader's intelligence and thoughtful imagination, we write only a fraction of what the Report would contain if it were, instead, an academic paper.* (""Half written is twice overwritten,"" *namuhs say.*) We omit most qualifying language (maybe, possibly, likely, probably, apparently, *etc.) as well as labored elaborations of logical consequences. On the flip side, the reader is obliged to supply the missing qualifiers &amp; elaborations (""to read nuance between blunt lines,"" as Namuhans say).*
2. *Namuhan Reports always open with a rhyme.* *Apologies in advance, I was never a great rhymer in Nahmuan, and I surely suck in English. But here goes...!*

**#1** I'll start with an ""Outlandish Claim"" that sounds too good to be true: an attractive hint of possibility.

**#2** But...is it actually possible? You'll express reasonable skepticism.

**#3** I'll convince you that the Claim is indeed possible and true and, in hindsight, obvious – so obvious, you're embarrassed for not thinking of it yourself. (You'll probably convince yourself that, secretly, you almost did think of it. But you didn't.)

→***Q:*** *This isn’t actually a game because (1) it doesn’t seem fun; and (2) if it’s a game, how can I WIN!!!?*

→**A:** I hear you, my human friend. But hold on, there's more.

**#4** You won’t just be convinced, you’ll be *inspired* – inspired to contribute your knowledge, &amp; skills, &amp; passion toward making the ""outlandish"" vision real. By bringing it to life, you win, you all win, everybody WINS!!!

How fun is *that*!

→***Q:*** *I don't think you understand the meaning of the word ""game.""*

→**A:** Maybe not, but don't be a pedant. Now, let's play.

→ → → →

What if I say, ""Regarding Humanity's collective medium-term future, there are two kinds of people: those with little optimism, and those with little justification.""

→**Q:** *The two kinds of people are, actually (1) those who believe there are two kinds of people, and (2) the rest of us, who aren't so simple-minded.*

→**A:** Dear Reader: what you say is perfectly correct, but you're making a mistake.

Remember, to read a namuahan Report implies active participation in its creation, and responsibility for the result.

It's YOUR responsibility to ""read nuance between blunt lines.""

In other words, you must piss on the Report with your brain, to mark your territory. (Does that make sense in English?)

Let's try again:

Regarding Humanity's collective medium-term future, there are two kinds of people: those with little optimism, and those with little justification.

Optimism is mostly insane, pessimism is mostly justified.

Can the gap between optimism and justification be narrowed?

Deliberately &amp; efficiently?

By reliable means?

**The Outlandish Claim** **(version #1)**:

It's much easier than you think, to engineer a global shift toward conditions that support justified optimism. Everything needed for the job either (a) already exists, or (b) can easily brought into existence.

→***Q:*** *I'm skeptical. Profoundly skeptical. Super-duper skeptical.*

→**A:** Of course you are. Your skepticism is reasonable. But if you stay until the end, you'll see your skepticism is mistaken. (Actually, you'll hardly be able to see it at all, any more.)

→***Q:*** *Are you saying that Humanity's medium-term future is rosy? That the turbulent field of global, synergistic instabilities will be calmed and stabilized? That cataclysm and collapse will be averted, and joy will become the next global pandemic?*

**A:** No, no, and no – of course not. We must not be Pangloss or Pollyanna. They are fictional characters, and we are real. In the real world, nobody can know such things, much less achieve the control necessary to guarantee them.

I'm only saying that you, Humanity, can choose to use reliable means to improve your chances of a successful future.

That's all: better chances. No specific results are guaranteed, because this ain't that kind of universe.

→***Q:*** *So you're saying . . . optimism can be justified only probabilistically, while dysfunction &amp; catastrophe might still end up with the last laugh?*

→**A:** Igzacktly.

Imagine you're playing a game in which the winner is first to 10 points. You're now leading 9-0. Your optimism is very high. Is it justified?

→***Q:*** *That feels like a trick question . . . but it seems like the answer must be ""yes.""*

→**A:** It's not a trick question (those will come later). Your optimism is, indeed, very well justified.

But unbeknownst to you, an airplane has malfunctioned in the sky above, and is plummeting toward the exact spot on Earth where you're preparing to play the final point. The last thing the doomed pilot sees is the scoreboard showing you ahead 9-0, and you dancing excitedly in anticipation of victory. The last thing the pilot thinks is that you're justified in believing you will score the winning point, but he's justified in believing you won't.

And he's right: you're both justified in your opposite beliefs, based on the different information available to you.

→***Q:*** *Isn't the pilot more justified than me, because he knows more?*

→**A:** That makes sense only from the point of view of the pilot, or from a God's-eye view).

Think:  if justification is an absolute (instead of probabilistic) property, its only legit foundation would be omniscience or omnipotence, which don't exist. And if a concept isn't useful in the real world, it isn't useful.

So we throw that idea out, and all that's left of justification is something that's relative to actual knowledge &amp; ability.

Now, we'll look at ways to increase the range &amp; depth of justifications for optimism. hile avoiding the perils of dogmatism (not perfectly, but about as well as possible).

remaining creatively flexible and alert,

**The Outlandish Claim** **(version #2)**:

TO THE EXTENT THAT the collective problems of global humanity have possible real solutions, it's fairly straightforward to figure out approximately what those solutions *must* look like, plus what they *might* look like, and so get ideas of how to build them.

NOT THAT any particular problem necessarily has (or lacks) especially satisfying solutions.

ONLY THAT so far as solutions are possible, finding &amp; implementing them is an ordinary practical problem that can be solved just like any other practical problem – like storing the entire Library of Congress on a thumbnail-sized bit of Earth's crust, or unsticking gum from the sole of your shoe.

Conditions of justification can be deliberately engineered: not by imposing pre-fab ideologies on the recalcitrant World (in the disastrous manner of times past &amp; present), but by using methods that are **harmonious with science**, and in a **spirit that is humanizing** – essential characteristics of any workable solution (a topic we'll pick up in the next section, *How to Begin*).

# HOW TO BEGIN

* There's no such thing as an abstract, generic solution. If something is a solution, it's a *particular* solution with particular characteristics.
* Some of those will be the characteristics by virtue of which it *is* a solution: the general characteristics of *any* workable solution.
   * ""Workable"": if it won't work in the real world, it won't work; if it won't work, it's no solution.
* The characteristics which *define* a solution as a solution are the same as those by which it can be *identified* as a solution.
* When what you seek is hidden mainly by your inability to recognize it within the landscape of realities &amp; possibilities, identifying its essential characteristics is the most part of finding it.

**→Q**: *So, the appropriate way to start building particular solutions . . .*

**→A**: THE appropriate way?? Are you sure there's only one way? There's no need to foreclose other possibilities.

**→Q**: *So, AN appriopriate way to start building particular solutions is to identify the general characteristics of any solution* . . . ?

**→A**: THE general characteristics?? That implies all of them.

You'll never identify all the characteristics of anything.

Remember, it must work in the real world. Avoid carelessly setting impossible tasks for yourself, or for anyone else.

**→Q**: So, AN appropriate way to start building particular solutions is to identify SOME important general characteristics of any solution . . . ?

**→A**: Much better. Exactly right.

**→Q**: *How do we do that?*

**→A**: Check the instruction Manual, obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

* There is no Manual.
* **The world is under no obligation to be as simple as any set of ideas about it** –
   * no matter how convincing, or persuasive, or compelling
   * no matter how ancient or hallowed
   * no matter how universally and unquestioningly accepted
   * no matter how deeply entrenched in institutions, language, and habit.","Bob Visits Earth to Help Humans Become Collectively Very Much Smarter WRT Their Collective Problems (and to gather some broccoli to bring back home to Htrae)",0.81,9,0,"2023-10-19 23:25:59"

“The future of global food production is under threat as temperature rises will impact farmers' physical capacity to work, a new study has revealed.”

""Assessments consistently conclude that climate change will reduce crop yields making food security challenges worse,"" says study lead Professor Gerald Nelson, of the University of Illinois.

""But it's not only crops and livestock that are affected. The agricultural workers who plant, till, and harvest much of the food we need will also suffer due to heat exposure, reducing their ability to undertake work in the field.""

“Published in the journal Global Change Biology, the study, titled ""Global reductions in manual agricultural work capacity due to climate change,"" involved using computational models to predict the physical work capacity (PWC)—defined as ""an individuals work capacity relative to an environment without any heat stress""—under different predicted climate change scenarios.”

“The maximum work capacity achievable by individuals in a cool climate was used as the benchmark for the study—representing 100% physical work capacity.

Reductions in capacity mean people are limited in what they can physically do, even if they are motivated to work. This may translate as farmers needing extra workers to do the same job, or if these are not available, then reducing their crop sizes.

Agricultural workers are already feeling the heat, the study reveals, with half the world's cropland farmers estimated to be working below 86% capacity in ""recent past"" (1991–2010) climate conditions.”

Report: “Global food production at risk as rising temperatures threaten farmers' physical ability to work, new study finds”: https://phys.org/news/2024-01-global-food-production-temperatures-threaten.html

Peer-reviewed scientific paper: “Global reductions in manual agricultural work capacity due to climate change”: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.17142

“Abstract
Manual outdoor work is essential in many agricultural systems. Climate change will make such work more stressful in many regions due to heat exposure. The physical work capacity metric (PWC) is a physiologically based approach that estimates an individual's work capacity relative to an environment without any heat stress. We computed PWC under recent past and potential future climate conditions. Daily values were computed from five earth system models for three emission scenarios and three time periods. Average daily PWC values were aggregated for the entire year, the growing season, and the warmest 90-day period of the year. Under recent past climate conditions, the growing season PWC was below 0.86 (86% of full work capacity) on half the current global cropland. With end-century/SSP5-8.5 thermal conditions this value was reduced to 0.7, with most affected crop-growing regions in Southeast and South Asia, West and Central Africa, and northern South America. Average growing season PWC could falls below 0.4 in some important food production regions such as the Indo-Gangetic plains in Pakistan and India. End-century PWC reductions were substantially greater than mid-century reductions. This paper assesses two potential adaptions—reducing direct solar radiation impacts with shade or working at night and reducing the need for hard physical labor with increased mechanization. Removing the effect of direct solar radiation impacts improved PWC values by 0.05 to 0.10 in the hottest periods and regions. Adding mechanization to increase horsepower (HP) per hectare to levels similar to those in some higher income countries would require a 22% increase in global HP availability with Sub-Saharan Africa needing the most. There may be scope for shifting to less labor-intensive crops or those with labor peaks in cooler periods or shift work to early morning.”

Basically, when we think about heat waves and droughts reducing crop yields, we need to realize that long before food production yields are crushed by climate change, our ability to grow food is most threatened by heat and humidity preventing farmers from planting, tilling, and harvesting crops in the fields. 

“Manual outdoor labor is essential in many agricultural systems worldwide. The interactions of the thermal environment (defined by air temperature, solar radiation, humidity, and wind speed) with metabolic activity and clothing can contribute to heat stress and affect the health and productivity of outdoor workers. Physical work capacity (PWC) begins to decline measurably around 20°C ambient temperature and further diminishes as temperature and humidity rise and exposure to solar radiation increases, while cooling from wind can reduce these effects.”

An eye opening new finding; something else to worry about:)

**The reason:** Fossil fuel corporations have attacked our home. Fossil fuel corporations are boiling the Earth for money.[They're adding degrees celsius onto the temperature of our planet as if it was just the cost of business](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/global-temperatures). They have committed fraud on an industrial scale to cover it up. And the temperature keeps rising. For decades, these companies have been ruining our future. Playing God. Holding back change. Until now. [They are being taken to court for their climate crimes](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiS_NXAgv2AAxUUU6QEHacbDxAQFnoECBAQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2023%2Fjun%2F07%2Fclimate-crisis-big-oil-lawsuits-constitution&amp;usg=AOvVaw0xkLAdX1xOdL3J9e4T1xxb&amp;opi=89978449).

Right now, our biggest obstacle is our collective inaction.

Fossil fuel corporations have paid marketers millions to convince us to remain inactive. Instead of admitting their mistake and reinvesting sustainably, they continued ruining our planet like the toxic ex that just won’t leave.

There have been decades of manipulation and lies from them - climate denial, telling us it was our responsibility, then pushing the idea that it was too late to save ourselves, all to promote inactivity. They are afraid of us taking action. They do not underestimate the backlash they will face.

**The plan:** It’s time to give them that backlash. Below we choose our lines of attack for this week.

The rules are simple. Post comments separately to ideas. **Put attack ideas in \[square brackets\]**. If you want to explain why you think the \[attack idea\] will work, put the explanation in the same comment outside of the \[brackets\].

**Upvote the ideas that are most likely to go viral**. I’ll put in a few ideas at the start to get the ball rolling.

We post the most upvoted attack ideas on different platforms. The ideas don’t have to be reposted in the same words. Build off of them. The key is to have a lot of people post variations on the same message. If enough people repeat the idea, it sticks. That’s our weapon against fossil fuel companies. Mass repetition.

Wanna save the planet? Sustain an online attack on fossil fuels. It needs to [last 6-8 weeks to have a long term effect on public opinion](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/re6FsKPgbFgZ5QeJj/effective-strategies-for-changing-public-opinion-a). Every Sunday we decide which ideas to attack with that week. During the week, post variations of the attack ideas on different platforms. Like and share other people who are doing the same. **Humour and** [outrage](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/21/anger-is-most-powerful-emotion-by-far-for-spurring-climate-action-study-finds) **tend to be the most effective.**

This is how we change the world, and how we do something about the climate crisis. Accelerate the end of fossil fuels. For the good of the planet and our collective future.

Yes, also vote, educate and support other long term solutions. But right now the world needs urgent action.

&gt;Confronting the climate crisis won’t be cheap. California is trying to figure out who will pay.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under a series of proposals being considered by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s appointees to the Public Utilities Commission, the wealthy would be forced to cough up, in the form of flat fees on their monthly electric bills. But so would middle-class families.  
&gt;  
&gt;The debate has raised difficult questions of socioeconomic justice and climate progress — and prompted a group of Democratic lawmakers to try to repeal a monthly fee requirement they approved less than two years ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;The details are complicated. I’ll do my best to explain the competing arguments.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the result needs to be wealthier Californians paying more for power.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Electricity rates are rising for everyone,” said Alexis Sutterman, a staffer at the California Environmental Justice Alliance. “But it’s especially burdening those who already pay a disproportionate amount of their income on their utility bills.”

I'm a college dropout working a night stock job and renting a house with my dad. I hate my life so much, but I cant bring myself to find a way to improve it. I have ADHD and anxiety in general, but my eco-anxiety is destroying my life.

Even seeing the slightest news about the environment, climate, and microplastics sends me into a spiral of depression and panic attacks.

Everyday its something new to worry about. I just got done signing some petitions for soil preservation, and it adds on another thing I'm stressing about, along with the climate and El Nino.

Why shouldn't I just give up at this point? I have accomplished nothing, I have no friends, no girlfriend, never had a good job or my own place to live. I never lived, and I will never get to live. I cry myself to sleep every night.

So why should I live, and why do any of you guys keep living despite what is coming? Scientists have made it clear that there is no hope left and we are all going to die, so what should I do?

I'm sorry that I keep spamming all of the climate subs with my rants, but I don't know where else to go. I don't know what to do. I feel so worthless and powerless because I cant do anything to stop this.

Below I make the case that our top level problem, above all else, is that **the global weather and climatic systems are too overloaded with energy currently**. Even if emissions stop tomorrow **we desperately need to store the carbon already up there.**

Which leads us to...

**‘Nature based solutions’** as our only real hope to buy enough time to reach net zero/negative.

**Rewilding, reforesting, habitat restoration and expansion both on land and at sea at unprecedented scale**. We need to dump as much carbon and other infrared active gases into the earth as possible in the next 5/7-12 years. We **just** **might avoid the most serious impacts being locked in before we sort out emissions.**

​A few doomers not reading the post and giving pushback keep missing that point. It's a hail Mary attempt to buy us a little extra time and keep an extra few hundred millions from climate poverty while we work on all the other strategies. Please no more posts about stopping oil- everybody on this sub agrees with that and it just shows you didn't fully read the post! Even if we stop oil tomorrow we still have a MASSIVE short/medium term problem. *This is a separate and under-discussed aspect that I wanted this sub's perspective on.*

I see a lot of posts here wondering what people can do to help avert climate breakdown in enough time. The comments are always filled with amazing suggestions from committed activists and I applaud you all.

This is a post about overall strategy to maximize impact. What are our top-level problems? **What specific actions can buy us enough time to achieve net-zero/negative before we cross too many tipping points?**

&amp;#x200B;

Every action taken by every individual here is key. Some people have existing skill sets and experiences they can deploy in the fight. For those that don’t yet, I present the option guaranteed to maximize your impact.

If people like this might I suggest the mods take some of this content and create an action resource or pin this post for a while?

(I elaborate further below with resources and links at the very bottom but you get the drift)

(Edited to make a few unclear points more clear, I have provided more detailed justification for why this should be overarching strategy below)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the top level target problem?**

**Problem 1**\- Global weather and climatic systems are too overloaded with energy currently.Too much heat retention for the planet.

**Problem 2-** It is hard to identify when we will cross each of the hundreds of tipping points.

**Problem 3**\- The web of life under us is rapidly unraveling.

Initial solutions:

**Problem 1:**

* ?????????????????????????????????

**Problem 2:**

* Reaching net zero/ environmental sustainability as far ahead of international targets as possible.
* Keeping fossil fuels in the ground.

**Problem 3:**

* Halting deforestation and biodiversity loss
* Habitat restoration

Problem 1 presents the greatest direct benefit but also is by far the most complicated to address.

&amp;#x200B;

**Problem 1-  Global weather and climatic systems are too overloaded with energy currently.**

It is hard to identify when we will cross each of the hundreds of tipping points.Accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.

Rapid geoengineering and climate cooling techniques- EXTREMELY RISKY- will we have any choice however? What choices will we be forced to make and can we get ahead of them?

Give the race to net zero some breathing space.

Will the floor of biodiversity fall out from beneath us?

Net negative global emissions as soon as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

**Policy type responses for RAPID extraction of energy from Earth systems.**

R1- Messing with cloud production, salting clouds and the oceans with various stuff

R2- Restoration and using existing biodiversity as a carbon store

From CARBON BRIEF

[https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached/](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached/)

“”The **Earth is currently out of thermal equilibrium**, meaning more energy from the sun is being trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere than is escaping back to space. Over 90% of this extra heat is going into warming the oceans. However, as the oceans continue to warm, they will take up less heat from the atmosphere and global average surface temperatures will rise further.

At the same time, the land and ocean are absorbing about half of the CO2 that humans emit each year. If emissions go to zero, these “carbon sinks” continue to take up some of the extra CO2 that was emitted in the past – quickly at first and then more slowly over time as they move toward a new equilibrium. This reduces the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and, thus, the warming it causes.

By chance, these two factors cancel each other out.””

“Human emissions of aerosols – tiny particles of sulfur or nitrogen suspended in the atmosphere that reflect incoming sunlight back to space – have a strong cooling effect on the planet, though there are large uncertainties as to exactly how large this effect is. Aerosols also have a relatively short atmospheric lifetime and, if emissions cease, the aerosols currently in the atmosphere will quickly fall back out.

As a result, the world would be around 0.4C warmer if CO2 and aerosol emissions go to zero, compared to zero CO2 emissions alone.”

Other GHGs are also important drivers of global warming. Human-caused emissions of methane, in particular, account for about a quarter of the historical warming that the world has experienced.

Unlike CO2, methane has a short atmospheric lifetime, such that emissions released today will mostly disappear from the atmosphere after 12 years. This is the main reason why the world would cool notably by 2100 if all GHG emissions fell to zero. This would result in around 0.5C of cooling compared to a scenario where only CO2 falls to zero.

***Appendix: Nature of the problem.***

The triple Climate, Biodiversity and Pollution Crisis. Areas 1 and 2 require Tier A attention as they are the most significant amplifiers of **interrelated systems collapse.** Next several years present an opportunity. How to maximize my impact in the next *7-10/12 years.* Many paths forward exist but how to decide what will work quickly enough.

**Rating system.**

Contribution to a scale solution

Will it make an impact quickly enough

**Area 1**

Problem 1- Significant amount of carbon up there already that is gonna fuck things up for a while. Carbon half life 120 years, denser molecules much shorter (Methane 14ish years)

Problem 2- Fair amount of molecules going up each year which amplifies Problem 1. Hence, race to net zero.

**Area  2**

Problem 3- The web of nature/ our planetary life support is unraveling, quickly. Unsustainable agricultural and forestation practices. The encroachment of the human concrete and built environment into the furthest reaches of every ecosystem.

Time and again, we've seen businesses either deny the necessity of change or treat climate risk as little more than a reporting issue. Case in point, one of our global clients once revealed that they had a higher budget for office muffins than for managing climate risk!

We believe a key issue lies in the lack of transparency within the industry. Through our interactions with many SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) participants, we've noticed that companies often sign off on climate plans without full transparency. The result? The public is led to believe the plans are effective, even when these companies miss or abandon their targets. 

So what does an ideal solution look like? According to scientists and ex-advisors of SBTi, it can only be credible if it's peer-reviewed by independent experts. However, the difficulty lies in balancing this need for verification with companies' reluctance to share confidential data. 

To solve this dilemma, we've come up with an approach we'd like your feedback on. Inspired by the open source community, we plan to compile effective climate solutions into open-source abatement plans for different sectors. Just like how browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge use the open-source Chromium as their foundation, companies can use these peer-reviewed plans as trustworthy references.

Our approach requires collective action and feedback from diverse perspectives. Hence, I'm excited to announce that we've created [https://www.rddi.org/](https://www.rddi.org/), an open platform where everyone, from any corner of the world, can either create climate solutions or craft reference implementation plans.

We will start adding implementable abatement plans for sectors this week or early next. Our goal is to create a community-owned resource, not influenced by any single entity - hence, while my firm 15Rock is funding this initiative, we hope to make it self-sustaining in the long run and governed by the community. 

We'd love to hear what you think! If there's anything similar out there or any aspects we should consider, let us know. Looking forward to your feedback, and thank you for your time!","Climate Action with Open-Source Abatement Plans - Need Your Insight!",1,3,0,"2023-07-04 12:43:48"

But I tend to wince when seeing climate opinion based and other proximal issue (like anxieties that emerge as a result of climate change/future impacts) research getting more attention than root/strategic, feasible, and actionable inquiry.

That said, there are usually ways to make good use of the information gathered from a study like yours too, and perhaps it can help become a key metric in some capacity. I just don't see a lot of assurances that gauging how people feel when meaningful paths for action are lacking. And 15-25 minutes is a substantial time for engagement.

So at the least please be sure to make efforts to align the work they put in with something that yields more substantive impact than just a research publication that reports on mental health findings related to climate change.



I don't know how to place this more gently or respectfully so apologies again as I really don't want to disregard the effort that went into your work so far:

It's good to care about mental health for youth, at the same time we already mostly know it's in the mix of stressors that people do or will encounter and I'm skeptical collecting more data is going to be useful as it falls into the ""more data/talking about action"" trap rather than spurring people towards actual action.

I feel like your efforts are better placed by strategically asking youth what they think, want, or intend to do to take action on climate change at scale even if their government institutions and more senior members of their communities aren't willing to do so.

Think maintenance trucks,  police cars, snow plows, and shuttle buses. This is largely due to high  upfront costs related to vehicle procurement and charging  infrastructure.   
Prior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act  (IRA), claiming tax credits was an enormously complex process for local  governments. Because cities and counties are not tax-liable entities,  big banks would claim tax credits on behalf of local governments, and  then pay them less than the value of the credits. Through the IRA, new  “direct pay” allows the federal government to give money directly to  municipalities for doing something it deems a public good (like  decarbonization efforts) instead of making it a tax credit. This makes  local decarbonization projects much more affordable and feasible.   
Constituents  have a role to play in communicating with local elected officials. We  can inform policymakers of the eligibility change with direct pay tax  credits and urge them to invest early in electric municipal fleets. We  can also connect policymakers with helpful resources as they evaluate  which vehicles to electrify and how to reduce costs.

Title is sufficient info but I would like to add a few things: I want to read a book or watch a documentary or listen to a podcast that will inform me objectively about all the aspects of the Anthropocene and climate change. I don't want to read long scientific reports that I won't understand. I have 0 science background so I need a ""human explanation"". I also want it to be centered around what the problem is, not around what is supposed to be the solution (I have my own ideas about that and I think what you see as the solution is more ideological and personal than scientific). I have been watching a lot of documentaries and reading lots of articles but they all focus on one or two aspects of climate change, rather than breaking down the whole thing. I would also like the source to be as close to today or to 2023 as possible, as it will be the most updated info. Podcast/documentary/book all are ok for me even though I generally prefer reading.

Many startling facts are revealed in this report: essentially the super rich 1% are responsible for 16% of global emissions, equivalent to the emissions of the poorest 66% of people (5 billion people) on the planet. How does this sound for inequality? 

It’s mind-boggling. 

This report was just released within the flurry of reports coming out just prior to the COP28 conference in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is very sobering. Yet, it also shows how significant a return to some semblance of equality would put a dent in our abruptly changing climate system predicament.

&gt;My introduction to climate change politics came via Al Franken.  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes, Al Franken, the “Saturday Night Live” comedian-turned U.S. senator who resigned from Congress amid accusations of sexual harassment. It was 2003, I was 11 years old, and I had stumbled across a copy of his new book, “Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right,” drawn in by the catchy title.  
&gt;  
&gt;Global warming wasn’t Franken’s focus. But his references to the brewing crisis resonated with me.  
&gt;  
&gt;He criticized then-President George W. Bush for ditching the Kyoto Protocol, a predecessor to the Paris climate agreement. He slammed Fox News host Sean Hannity for refusing to acknowledge the role of SUVs in rising temperatures. He condemned then-Vice President Dick Cheney’s oil industry ties, and featured a New York Times front page with an article about melting glaciers.  
&gt;  
&gt;The more I learned about carbon pollution, the more obvious it felt to preteen me that something was deeply amiss with American politics. Why weren’t we quickly switching to renewable energy? How long could one of our two major political parties act like nothing was wrong? I had the same questions after going to see Al Gore’s film “An Inconvenient Truth” in 2006, and after studying sustainable development in college, and after beginning my career as an energy journalist in 2014.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have the same questions now.

"40355","kz8mjlh",2,"I’m sorry, but you’re just wrong. $20 billion would be transformative for my region. I regularly work with towns that are putting in around $10-20 million to upgrade things like water infrastructure, which is a huge lift for small towns with small tax bases. Programs like this are essential for bridging that gap in funding. The BIL is investing over $1 trillion in infrastructure upgrades. 

If you want a ban on fossil fuels, we have to have something to take their place. I promise, as rugged as you think you are, your community could not function well without electricity. That’s why they’re putting billions into the renewable transition and grid upgrades we’ll need to pull that off and why there’s such immediacy to the push for it. These grid and infrastructure upgrades are absolutely crucial if we’re going to survived, full stop.

I get that this is scary, depressing work, but that is exactly why we should be looking at progress objectively and recognizing it when it’s happening. If you personally aren’t in an emotional space to do that, that’s fine, but it doesn’t change the math for those of us on the ground who are actually moving the needle on climate resilience. So when I say that this is a huge investment that will be transformative for these communities, I’m not just saying it. 

To give you another example, I’ve spent the last year using some of this funding to set up large scale community solar, geothermal, and biomass projects in the frontier that will replace coal and oil systems as well as individual generators, which are necessary for blackouts out here. I can get a good community solar project up and running for ~$4 million with the right people.

Our only chance is positive tipping points. I’ve often talked about “my three legged barstool approach”: 1) slash fossil fuel emissions; 2) deploy Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR); also for methane, and 3) Deploy Solar Radiation Management (SRM) to cool the planet to buy us time, by stopping tipping, to do 1) and 2). 

This report kind of ignores SRM. That’s why you need to read Gwynne Dyers new book “Intervention Earth”. I like how he says SRM is an accountants term.

I propose a new acronym, for the very first time, here in my video.

We need to call it SOS. Yes, for Save Our Souls. Also standing for:

Solar Optimizing Systems — SOS’s
Solar Optimization Systems — SOS’s
Solar Optimizing Solutions — SOS’s
Solar Optimization Solutions — SOS’s

We have changed the chemistry of our atmosphere and oceans and destabilized our planetary systems.

Now, we need to save ourselves. We need SOS systems to rebalance our energy flows and maintain a liveable planet.

Frankly, it is our only option.

But I do think that it will deliver in spades once it begins.

\-v-

Going with and using the global warming as the driving force, instead of fighting it, We can make or choose regional and selected coastal waters to let or even assist heating up enough to create steam (cloud cover), near coasts and at the head of the air jet and oceangoing streams so it all drifts down over the rest of the seas cooling them.

Although costly, It would  still be cheaper then the alternative, longer lasting with less maintenance, and chemicals wouldn't be needed for seeding, aircraft for seeding wouldn't be needed as much, and there wouldn't be as large of a CO2 footprint since no fuels would be needed..

Mostly would have to find ways to help the zones heat up faster then the rest of the local seas creating enough steam to help cool down the rest, and ways to keep sea and land animals out of and away from those (rather large, miles worth) zones. Glass and other materials are capable of focusing the heat, without the need of fuels or electricity and its a cheap resource.

It would help kill off some of the local environment thats in and around the zones, But there is a price for everything and it would be localized in zones, The seas are heating up anyways, and its desperate times were heading into with few options and something major needing to be done.

And maybe someday when we dont need them any more, we can safely remove the heat intensifiers, if not recycle them or use them in other places.

Under the seas we may be able to add ways to cool off large areas using the ocean's own currents to pass along the cooler waters. if not filter them too.

"363564","k89abop",1,"A new analysis published this week suggests that extreme weather linked to climate change might be much harder on native species than on nonnative ones.

&amp;#x200B;

The new paper, published on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution by a team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, suggests that these sudden, violent changes in conditions could be helping to fundamentally reshape ecosystems.

&amp;#x200B;

The study found, on average, nonnative species tended to show more positive responses to extreme weather, or, at least, less negative ones. Where nonnative land species might take a hit in population numbers from a disaster, for example, the effects on native land species could sometimes be more far-reaching, with native populations also losing geographic distribution and struggling to recover.

The changes in albedo due to moderate rainfall increases are hard to detect compared to changes due to agriculture (which can both increase and decrease the albedo locally depending on the situation). 

&gt; decreases

Quantatively, biggest observed jumps are due to intesification agriculture, f.e. multiple cropping practices, where a field is replanted to produce another harvest several times a year. This is typical for most moderate to high income areas in the norethern hemisphere. 

&gt; increases

On the other hand, in many places soil degradation achieves the opposite. Good [example](https://imgur.com/a/mMqViod) (Burkina Faso, region around Tita) are the protected areas (no farming allowed) in the sahel. These have a consistently lower albedo compared to surrounding area.

Most (likely all) of the long-term increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has been from the use of fossil fuels, with the ocean being a net carbon sink rather than source for the atmosphere.

&gt; Board member Will Hickman, who works as an in-house attorney for Shell Oil, asked a testifier whether instructional materials “should also include the benefits” of burning carbon.

We can't deny the ""benefits"" of burning fossil fuels. And it should be taught in order to give a complete understanding of society and technology. But we also can't deny the physical science of climate change, nor can we deny the consequences of continued fossil fuel use. Here's what I propose:

- A class that teaches the science of climate change. Not the impacts per say, but the physics. Energy balance, the basic role of greenhouse gases, atmospheric circulation, ocean circulation, the role of the cryosphere, climate change (forcings and feedbacks), paleoclimate, and future climate change. This would have to be its own class. It can't just be a module in Biology.

- A class that teaches the""benefits"" of fossil fuels (not a class exclusively for that, but a history class). This class would provide a historical context for humanity's use of fossil fuels. It's important to not let the fossil fuel industry touch this one since they could use it to push a narrative.

- A class that discusses the impacts human-caused climate change has on societies and natural systems. This is a social science course with a dash of basic environmental science. How have people changed the natural world? What are the consequences of these changes? 

With these three classes, I think the student would be provided with a well-rounded education of the basics of climate change. Science, context, and awareness. We cannot just shut down what we don't want to hear, especially to children likely learning about this stuff for the first time.

By providing an incomplete education to these kids, they'll have an incomplete understanding of real life as adults. Not knowing the historical context of fossil fuels will damage their ability to understand what is required of climate solutions. But if they're only shown the ""benefits"" of fossil fuel use and nothing more, they'll never understand the severity of human-caused climate change.

The science class grounds the other two in reality. By forming a literacy in the science of the Earth's systems, these kids will be able to identify misinformation and disinformation from climate change denial and those claiming the world will come to an end.

"358048","k8ysdul",1,"&gt; No but emissions are not the same as consumption. Emissions depend on the efficiency of the processes which can be different between the processes and different from what companies estimate emissions from the processes.

These emissions are directly related to fossil fuels consumption. There's no ambiguity here, if you burn 1kg of coal you know exactly how much CO2 was emitted.

&gt; I've also read that the oceans and plants decrease their ability to absorb CO2 as the concentrations get higher.

Indeed. They're still absorbing [about half of human emissions](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5110/) every year though; this is nice because if we stop emissions ""tomorrow"" CO2 concentrations will start to decline immediately.

&gt; You can see there was no drop in the increase in CO2 concentrations even during covid when emissions were reported as actually decreasing due to low economic activity.

For sure. Emissions were still way too high during covid. People didn't fly or drive that much, but we were still consuming a ton of dirty energy for other stuff.

&gt; I'm saying if you take the data from the plot shown in the link I just posted and project that curve out to the year 2100 you get enough CO2 PPM concentrations in the atmosphere that would raise the temperature to 3.6C above pre-industrial temperatures. Does that explain what I'm talking about?

Right, some kind of linear extrapolation of CO2 concentrations. Fortunately this is not what's going to happen. We're investing heavily in low-carbon energy and in electrification, so fossil fuels are becoming obsolete. Just one example: solar is now the cheapest source of electricity almost everywhere, so even without policy support it's expected to become the dominant source of electricity within a couple of decades.

&gt; But everything I've been reading lately is the opposite as oil companies are planning more exploration and extractions

Yes, they are Kodak-ing themselves. There will be no market for most of this. They really don't want to believe how obsolete they are.

The IEA, which can't be accused of being optimistic about renewables, is expecting them to account for [almost 95% of the increase in global power capacity through 2026](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2021/executive-summary). They're just cheaper nowadays, including in developing nations, so they are starting to eat the market share of coal and gas.

Essentially, this report argues that Earth is facing dire sea level rise — up to 20m — even if climate goals are met and the global average temperature is stabilized at 2 degrees Celsius relative to the IPCC baseline 1850-1900 average. 

I discuss the main findings in this report, and have a look at what the figures tell us in specific areas of glacier melt, permafrost thaw and emissions feedbacks, Arctic and Antarctica polar temperature amplification and sea ice loss, polar ocean acidification, and changes to ocean circulation patterns and consequences.

By the way, we are heading to a 2023 global average temperature of 1.54 degrees Celsius or higher, and on November 18, 2023 the daily average temperature reached 2.0 degrees C above the IPCC baseline for the first time.

It appears that by the start of next year, we will only legitimately and honestly be able to discuss the 1.5 C temperature goal in the past tense. Recall that in the James Hansen video recently, I chatted about 1.71 C by 2030 and 2 C by 2038 with James.

I always focus on these things to encourage people to transition their careers:  
\- **Rewarding work**: Climate jobs are an opportunity for you to make meaningful individual climate action. This is 40+ hours a week that you can dedicate to working on climate solutions. We need millions of people working in this space and it feels damn good to have a rewarding job.  
\- **Money**: Climate jobs pay competitively. It's a great time to get your foot in the door while the industry is still in its early stages. EQUITY.   
\- **Growth opp**: many climate jobs are startups and that means massive growth potential. The job you enter the company with will not be the same role in 2+ years. At smaller companies, you can have the opportunity to wear more hats (aka have more say and actually be at the forefront of change).  
\- **Community:** the climate community is no joke. It's so easy + fun to make connections in this space. There is real power to working alongside people who have similar values to you. The climate stoke/optimism runs high!

The private jets of the wealthy are a flea on the elephant of greenhouse gas emissions. If you want to punish rich people, then do that.

Let's not dilute and confuse the climate debate by turning it  into class warfare. If you do that the Republicans will credibly claim that climate activists' real motives are to tear down the rich.

&gt;Good luck getting that passed. And, on the rare chance that it passes, good luck preventing its repeal, as it was repealed in Australia.

The Australian carbon taxes were used to reduce income taxes. This is the wrong way. Instead, revenues from a carbon tax should be distributed like how Alaska mails out every year the collection of oil taxes to all citizens in the form of a check. A $1,000 check in hand is a much more tangible reward than an income tax cut and makes a much stronger impression. Plus you would get your class warfare as everyone who consumes carbon and especially the rich in private jets would pay in, but every citizen would get a $1,000 check including those who bike and ride the bus.

&gt;Carbon taxes will happen, but don't count on them for heavy lifting.

3,649 economists including 28 Nobel Laureates disagree with you and think a carbon tax is our most effective weapon against carbon emissions.

"116117","ktna0xk",3,"Dozens of cities along the US coastline are sinking at alarming rates, leaving them far more exposed to devastating flooding from sea level rise than previously thought, scientists reported Wednesday.

As oceans rise and the coasts sink, up to 343,000 acres of land will be exposed to destructive flooding by 2050, from hazards such as hurricanes, coastal storms and shoreline erosion, according to the [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07038-3) published in the journal Nature. In a worst-case scenario, roughly 1 in 50 people in the 32 cities analyzed could be exposed to flood threats.

According to the researchers, this is the first study to combine the increasing threat of sea level rise with high-resolution measurements of sinking areas to determine which coastal locations are most at-risk of inundation. “Every single result of this research is novel,” said Manoochehr Shirzaei, a geophysicist at Virginia Tech and co-author of the study.

The impact of sinking land has been overlooked, said Leonard Ohenhen, the lead author of the study and a doctoral researcher at Virginia Tech. “When you have these two different processes laid out — land sinking on the coast and sea rising on the ocean — you’re going to have a lot more areas that will be susceptible to flooding in the future,” he told CNN.

This book is:

“An Awesome Tale of Survival as a Young Girl and her AI (sic Artificial Intelligence) Friend Negotiate the Near-Term World of Climate Mayhem” 
— Paul Beckwith

This story takes place in a near future where climate change has hit and hit hard. 

Our young heroine Sarah, and her best friend JanetH (who happens to be an AI) work together to solve mysteries for mostly small businesses. This work is disrupted when Sarah’s friend and ex-lover vanishes (not too surprising since he was always a shady character). 

A major climate disruption in Southeast Asia has put the world into a full food insecurity crisis. This has caused great social distress in America over how much of their food can be exported to ease the oversees shortages. 

A black-market gang has hijacked a grain shipment intended for overseas shipments to the devastated crisis regions; many thousands of people are endangered due to this grain heist.

The human-AI team (Sarah and JanetN) spring into action to investigate the grain heist especially since it also appears directly related to the disappearance of Sarah’s friend. 

The hunt is on.

Our intrepid team negotiates a climate changed landscape of heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods, and overall turmoil, as they get closer and closer to the truth about the grain heist and their friends disappearance. 

The science of this climate ravaged world is as accurate as possible in the novel.

I can see in the storyline how author Tom Riley has followed my videos and work on abrupt climate system mayhem for many years, and has woven this climate science knowledge into an exciting backdrop to the fictional quest of a young girl and her AI best friend into a mystery and suspense as they track criminal elements throwing chaos into global food supplies in an already dicey situation.

In this video, I think I have the perfect backdrop to chat about the new novel “Dark Heat”. I was walking Newton between Christmas and New Years in a dog park in Ottawa (latitude 45 degrees N) and it is literally balmy and raining. Normal temperatures for Ottawa this time of year are -10C, and instead we are seeing days as warm as 10C. The snow from a few weeks ago has all melted, and there are only some ice patches left, basically islands in the mud. We know global average temperatures for 2023 will be above 1.5C. Also, many of the trees in this dog park (Conroy Pit) were destroyed in a span of 10 minutes by a powerful derecho 2 summers ago, and the area still looks like a tornado went through, only all the trees were toppled in the same direction.

Climate disruption is accelerating at ever faster rates. We need to prepare our young people for the world coming to us, and climate fiction put into TV programs seems like one good way to teach them these things.

Thanks, Tom Riley, for an excellent CliFi story.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting a year ago, I became hyper-aware of, well... a lot of what's going wrong with the world.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past six months, I've been trying to think of ways to actually make a difference as a low-income citizen with zero connections and effectively no social network. The average worker, basically. And as everyone here is well aware, the average worker views themselves as more or less powerless on their own (acting as a collective = the only way forward).

&amp;#x200B;

But I have a few skills that may be helpful to subs and communities like this-- one of them seems to be an obsession with the interconnected nature of the problems discussed here and elsewhere. I want to frame the most significant ones in ways that don't leave you feeling hopeless, in ways that demonstrate progress can be made (and how best to make that progress).

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of moving parts, and this post doesn't need to be an essay. To start with, I'm going to build a social media presence that acts as a unifier for discussing tech, socioeconomic dysfunction, the climate crisis and other ecological disasters, and the manipulation occurring in each of those vectors. This will ideally lead to crowdsourcing research, cooperatives, etc. The first content slated for release on social media is a series that I've nicknamed ""The Problem Series"", eight episodes running 45-60 minutes each. Here's where I'd love some input! Let me know what you think of the following topics/premises, whether they accurately portray the biggest problems we're all facing, and if they seem compelling enough to gain traction:

&amp;#x200B;

(Episode titles are intentionally clickbait-ish to accommodate audience demographics, suggest a different order if you strongly feel that a certain sequence of information presentation would be more logical...)

&amp;#x200B;

**1.  Problem #1: Capitalism's Death Spiral:**

Breaks down why the vast majority of human-created issues now stem from unregulated corporate practices. This includes wage stagnation, wealth consolidation, climate change, the plastic/waste crisis, the housing crisis etc. The intent here is to provide an abstract-level overview that will touch on core problems while illustrating their intersection with one another.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Nobody is an Island: The Myth of Rugged Individualism:**

Drawing on historical analysis, sociological research, and personal narratives, this episode examines the myth of rugged individualism and its role in shaping Western society's values and attitudes. The idea that we should deify those who successfully carve an outsized portion of resources for themselves (the ""self made"" billionaires and friends) is inherently toxic and enables extreme levels of passiveness in general citizenry as we watch a select few bleed us dry.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Your Landlord is a Robot: Notes on Our Next Housing Crisis:**

The title here takes aim both at the actual AI-driven real-estate bidding wars expected to escalate across the next decade as well as at the current practices of ""human"" landlords running rackets on millions of low-income citizens world-wide. Here, we examine alternatives such as selective applications of communal infrastructure and other collectivist ideals, regulatory measures to eliminate the practices discussed, and other municipality-level approaches that yield more security for at-risk populations.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Co-op 101: Building a Better Future :**

This episode deviates somewhat from an immediate focus on problems and instead tries to paint an anticipatory picture of what some of our core infrastructure, utilities, and modes of business might look like in a highly-regulated flavor of capitalism (one that leverages the principles of things like ""universal basic utilities""; water/electricity/food are treated as basic human rights in this hypothetical)

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Skepticism 101: Let’s Dissect Corporate (Lies):**

Dedicated to taking aim at corporations and monopolies whose legacy of moral bankruptcy continues to harm everyone outside of a minuscule segment of the global population. The aim is to objectively categorize and examine the strategies used by these entities to persuade citizens to ignore the social, financial, and environmental costs incurred by their self-centered practices; the motives that drive these levels of apathy, and what effective organized responses from those impacted would actually look like.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Working Until You Die: Income Inequality Explained:**

The title here is pretty self-explanatory imo. The intent is to explore the existing trends tied to retirement and the cost of living, and examine what happens in societies that have eroded their social safety nets-- what happens when you simply cannot afford to age out of your work or become disabled? This absolutely stretches beyond retirement, but it's a very potent image to consider since this has historically been the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" for those below the upper class.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Every Purchase is Violence: The Real Cost of Consumerism:**

The title may seem hyperbolic until you realize the percentage of the labor/supply chain for consumer goods that are built on outright slavery or extreme animal cruelty. This is another very difficult-to-look-at global phenomenon. But as I mentioned in the intro to this post, I will also deep dive into the lovely handful of companies that are thoroughly pursuing solutions to these issues, and illustrate how other companies can be pressured or convinced to do their part (no, this isn't just boycotting).

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Forever Automated: AI Wants to Replace You at Work:**

More clickbait phrasing, but the crux of it is proving to be exceptionally accurate. We are set to witness the permanent down-sizing of many creative and white collar industries... but we shouldn't be surprised in the least. This episode examines why the writing has been on the wall for centuries when it comes to automating every available function within the workplace, and why objectively different rules apply to the worker displacement seen during the industrial revolution versus the AI and computing revolutions. Remember: if you can describe your jobs as a series of steps, a robot or AI-augmented system can and will take it.

**9. You, Me, Us : Fighting for Today instead of Tomorrow:**

I have to end it on a high note. This has to be a series that provides some kind of ray of hope for people like me, the ones waking up fucking sad everyday when we think about what the world is turning into. This is the start of a project that proposes to incrementally shift the tracks until our runaway train is diverted onto a safer path. An exit ramp strategy, if you will. This isn't holding hands and singing ""We Are the World"", this is a declaration of organized resistance built on extending compassion and thoughtfulness into structured change.

(Always click the green + button for detailed research.) Like most Voter's Guides, we score incumbents on pivotal climate votes in Congress. We also assess a candidate's position: what do candidates say about the issue; leadership: what do they do; and putting a fee on carbon polluters. The average of those scores creates their Climate Calculation.

In 2022 for the first time, we indicate if a candidate supports Roe v. Wade. We see a strong connection between climate and choice, so while it is not part of our Climate Calculations, we have included support or opposition to Roe v.

There is no comparison between our priority candidates and their opponents on climate change. Four of five of the opponents have a Climate Calculation of 7.5 or less and the other one scores 28.75, all failing grades on any scale. Every opponent opposes Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion and many of them are 2020 election deniers.

Not only about the current and future impacts of global warming, climate change and biodiversity loss, but also about how people might react to it. I worry that people will give into defeatism and create a self-fulfilling prophecy, or that they will turn to fascism. It does not help that pseudoscience and conspiracy theories are rapidly spreading throughout the internet—as some people exploit the ongoing catastrophe for their own benefit.

I have been manipulated by such groups in the past, who use concepts like abrupt extinction or near term apocalypse to spread their own ideologies and to prey on people. There are online cults with thousands, even tens of thousands, of followers who do just that. I want to report them, but places like YouTube just don't seem to take such things as disinformation and sexual harassment seriously, so I don't know what to do.

I want to do something about it, both climate change and how people respond to it, but my power is incredibly limited as an individual. I'm not sure what to do. I am just a person; I can't control the situation or how others may behave. I can't just make corporations stop burning fossil fuels or force people to engage with action.

Having said that, I do know that my Doomscrolling compulsions and my obsessive need to monitor the growth of Defeatist/Denier communities is not helping anything. It is overwhelming me and crippling my ability to be an activist.

Checking in on places like r/Collapse all the time doesn't do much for me, especially as they tend to take media headlines at face value and don't always follow the science nowadays. But I can't seem to stop myself.

This is a form of self harm for me, and it is tied to a lot of deeper trauma problems, so I do know that therapy is really the only thing that would properly help. Having said that, I was wondering if anyone else here struggles with these kinds of compulsions? Does anyone else digitally self-harm through extreme Doomist content?

How do you deal with it?

I want to be able to properly engage with activism, adaptation and permaculture, but I can't if I am constantly paralysed by anxiety and depression.

"23596","l0f1v5v",1,"That was generally my thinking for a while - a bit of new nuclear, keep the existing nuclear as long as possible. Use the nuclear as base load for when conditions don't suit renewables. Do the short term decarbonisation with renewables and have nuclear mop up at the end.

But I have changed my mind for a few reasons.

First, nuclear keeps getting more expensive while every year, while everything else - wind, solar, tidal, geothermal, storage (of various forms) etc gets cheaper. These technologies dramatically mitigate the variability of wind and solar. Geothermal is not variable. Tidal is completely predictable and, paired with storage is effectively always on. Add to this new interconnectors that can bring power from countries where it's abundant to where it's needed, including, in the uk, once from North Africa!

https://xlinks.co/morocco-uk-power-project/
 
New nuclear on the drawing board now is just eye-wateringly expensive. Sizewell C is expected to be around £40 billion for 3GW. This is just a laughable sum compared to the same generation from solar, wind and storage.

Just as an aside, storage using V2G EVs will put literally terawatt hours of energy at the disposal of grid operators. Imagine 20 million EVs with 50KWh of charge available plugged into smart, bidirectional chargers at homes and offices. That represents a TWh of storage available to the grid. That is more than a 36 hours worth of uk energy consumption with no extra storage on the grid. Etc.

So it looks like there will be much less necessity for ""base load"" generation. Instead, I think the grid will be orders of magnitude better and storing energy, reducing demand when necessary and moving power around over large geographical areas to balance supply and demand.

Second, we are on steep learning curves for the various forms of storage, grid tech, tidal, geothermal and load management. If we apply some reasonable cost curves to these technologies over the next 15-20 years, then by the time new nuclear conceived now would come online, it will be extremely expensive and outdated. In 2040, it will seem like a technology from a bygone era compared to what is being built at the time. Not just expensive but complex and requiring a whole cadre of specialist workers who will be very rare. Like people who knew how to run steam locomotives in the 1960s.

I don't see good evidence that SMRs will fix much. Last year, the first demo unit in the UK was announced by Rolls Royce to be ready in 2029 but it is already delayed. And these units are notoriously expensive. Even if they can be commercialised and produced at scale, they will still be comparatively expensive and they won't be commercially ready until the late 2030s, if everything goes to plan. Plus they have significant security risks due to the distribution of waste materials all over place. I think they should be pursued but only as a plan B honestly.","science","2024-04-20 07:37:38","1c73nyw","michaelrch",0,1,0,"True","2018-05-18 09:22:27",1510,149,34582,74191,110432,13,"","The Fantasy of Reviving Nuclear Energy",0.79,13,0,"2024-04-18 13:42:36"

Over the course of the fellowship, I began to recognize the impressive and cheap climate benefit of designing cities for people instead of cars. Whatever cars there will be in the future should be electric, but the switch should really be from cars to active transportation and transit for most people.

After spending a full year in the climate-adjacent space of urbanism and transportation design (fueled by The War on Cars, Booked on Planning, Reinventing Parking (podcasts); The High Cost of Free Parking, Walkable City, Paved Paradise (books); and media from Strong Towns and the Parking Reform Network (non-profits), I went to visit with my city planner.

We've now been to a Planning Commission meeting and then to a Zoning and Subdivision Committee meeting together, where I presented and argued for a proposal that I wrote, which aims to eliminate minimum parking requirements in our town -- a very important (first) step in making the city one that can be accessed and enjoyed by all modes of transportation. The outcome of all this is still uncertain, but I hope that you might consider reading the proposal and, if you find it agreeable, take up the cause in your city.

Thank you.

High wealth uncaring people, however, could make much more sizeable reductions fairly easily. Regulation is so much more effective as it reaches these people. And it reaches corporations whose effects are even more grossly unbalanced.

There’s also a place for local connections. Conversations with friends, family, or in the workplace can have big effects with little effort. They might also effect people’s votes and some might spread beyond your immediate connections via people you convince. It’s also a necessary contrast to many well-funded groups and even nation states spouting bullshit to sew discontent over the issue.

On a personal level though, if you care about the issue and believe that your positive impacts outweigh your negative impacts, this can be a big relief. Instead of some people feeling like they are a burden and shouldn’t go out, have kids, etc. you can know that you belong and are useful despite the carnage elsewhere.

2. GoFundMe, asking for small monthly donations eg $10

3. A campaign geared at people approaching end of life, encouraging legacy donations whereby they would will a portion of all of their money to the foundation when they pass

I was factoring in capacity factor, otherwise we're comparing apples to pineapples (15-20% for solar, 20-45% for wind, 60-70% for NG, 40-60% for coal, 90-95% for nuclear)

I also don't think that taking the absolute worst example on the planet is very representative though. I was thinking more along the average, which is about $4 billion/GW the past 20 years.

Gas &amp; coal plants are cheaper than that too. Solar &amp; wind is usually way cheaper than that as well - perhaps this project includes storage, or backup solutions?

The Finnish massive over-budget nuclear plant cost $11 billion and provides 1.6GW electrical capacity and 4.2GW heat energy. At a low 90% capacity factor that still comes out to 5.2GW of actual 24/7 production.

The articles is stating 100GW of sticker production capacity. If that's solar that's 20% effective production capacity, or 20GW, which is $5 billion/GW of net production.

**Recent extreme heatwaves dwarfed by projected future events**

In recent decades, unprecedented heatwaves have resulted in substantial impacts on human health and their environment. Previously, heatwave trend analysis has largely focused on trends across global warming thresholds or on specific regions. Furthermore, a variety of diverse heatwave parameters has been applied across separate studies, hampering direct comparison. What is more, there has been limited information on how future projections of individual events compare to recent extreme heatwaves.

In our study, we define heatwaves as periods of at least three consecutive days where daily area-weighted mean temperature exceeds the regional 90th percentile. We utilize a comprehensive analysis framework based on four heatwave parameters and additional sub-parameters where appropriate: (1) heatwave duration in days, (2) heatwave severity, an intensity index enabling interpreting excess heat relative to the regional climatology, (3) cumulative heat, and (4) percentage of locally affected area. The latter is an area-based parameter providing information on the exceedance of local (grid cell level) climatology thresholds during the course of an individual heatwave in percent of the respective region’s overall area. For parameters (2) and (4) we, moreover, investigate two sub-parameters, namely median and maximum values. The first sub-parameter refers to the median value of the entire heatwave, whereas the second indicates that this maximum value is being reached for at least one day during the event. This analysis framework greatly increases the ability for individual heatwave-based and regional intercomparison, and, furthermore, explores both regional as well as local scale trends, thereby providing critical human-impact-oriented information. In addition to daily output from multi-model ensembles from models taking part in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and 6 and large initial-condition ensembles (CanESM5 and ACCESS-ESM1-5), we employ our framework to 14 regional events observed during the period of 2010-2021 and analyzed based on Berkeley Earth and ERA5. This provides crucial insights into how future heatwaves compare to recent events.

Our results indicate that recently observed extreme heatwaves are dwarfed by projected 21st century events. Moreover, without even moderate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions the probability of reoccurrence or exceedance of these recent extreme reference values is significantly increasing, and they are still plausible under aggressive emission reduction scenarios.

In conclusion, we can see that a lack of mitigation and adaptation measures could considerably increase human exposure to extreme heat. In particular as we found, depending on the scenario, significant increases in the percentage of locally affected area and the heatwave severity. Thus, these findings stress the necessity for substantial and ambitious mitigation efforts and for considering heatwaves well outside the lived experience for effective adaptation measures.

Consider investing your money into index funds that vote your shares for the climate. Doing so allows 
you to vote hundreds of times per year on climate issues. My two favorite funds which proxy your
shareholder rights are the [Sphere Fossil-Free Mutual Fund](https://www.oursphere.org/the-index#?index)
(`$SPFFX`) and the [Engine No. 1 Transform 500 Fund](https://etf.engine1.com/vote/) (`$VOTE`). 
Both of these funds offer low expense ratios and roughly track the S&amp;P 500. My personal preference 
favors `$SPFFX` over `$VOTE`. 

## Introduction

Your retirement fund choices are likely proxying your shareholder voting rights 
against corporate climate proposals _hundreds of times_ per year. Retirement fund options, like 
Vanguard's mutual funds, overwhelmingly vote how company management recommends. As you might expect, 
management recommendations are often diametrically opposed to what the climate science demands 
humanity must do. For example, the following is a sample of votes that the Vanguard 500 Index Fund 
(`$VFIAX`) took on behalf of shareholders in 2022.

| Company                            | Proposal                                                                                                | Management Recommendation | `$VFIAX` Vote^1 |

## ESG Is a False Solution

While environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) funds aim to solve 
the above maligned corporate incentives, they're not good investment vehicles and 
don't sway corporate climate policy as much as you'd expect or hope. Climate 
concerned opponents of ESG have been raising concerns about the 
[reporting and disclosure problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance#Disclosure_and_regulation)
with ESG funds, for example. 

From an investing perspective ESG funds are suboptimal. ESG indexes are typically 
actively managed and require much higher administrative fees than their passively 
managed counterparts. The table below shows some of the most popular ESG funds 
and their associated cost over 30 years of investing the maximum 401k contribution 
in 2022 ($22,500). 

| Fund Name                       | Ticker   | Expense Ratio | Cost over 30 years | Nest egg value after 30 years |
|---------------------------------|----------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund | `$VFTAX` | 0.14%         | $43,228            | $1,735,580                    |
| iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF | `$SUSA`  | 0.26%         | $79,334            | $1,699,475                    |
| Parnassus Core Equity Investor  | `$PRBLX` | 0.82%         | $236,895           | $1,541,913                    |
| Shelton Green Alpha Fund        | `$NEXTX` | 1.16%         | $324,364           | $1,454,444                    |

The lackluster voting record of the above ESG funds above were bimodal. The cheaper funds (Vanguard's
and BlackRock's) tended to vote poorly on climate proposals. The more expensive and carefully 
curated funds tended to vote better for climate, but lacked exposure to some of the biggest companies 
during the shareholder voting process to make a big difference. Notably, `$NEXTX` only holds 51 companies,
roughly 1/10th of the S&amp;P 500's size. 

| Company                       | Proposal                                                                                                | Management Recommendation | `$VFTAX` Vote^1 | `$SUSA` Vote^2 | `$PRBLX` Vote^3 | `$NEXTX` Vote^4 |

So what avenues do we have to make sure our money isn't working against us
during shareholder votes, while also maintaining a responsible and diversified 
retirement portfolio?

## Passive Funds, Active Investing

An exceptional balance between a responsible investment vehicle for your retirement 
nest egg and climate action is what I call ""passive funds, activist investing"". 
These are funds which track a pre-formulated index, such as the S&amp;P 500, and 
simply proxy your shareholder rights in favor of climate. The two funds 
I've found which do that well are the Sphere Fossil-Free Mutual Fund and The Engine 
No. 1 Transform 500 ETF.

### The Sphere Fossil-Free Mutual Fund

The Sphere Fossil-Free mutual fund (`$SPFFX`) is similar to `$VFIAX` in that it seeks to track
the largest companies in the United States, but deviates by opting to exclude major climate
antagonists like oil, gas, and some investor-owned utilities. It currently tracks 414 of the
top 500 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 and offers an expense ratio of 0.07%, half of the cheapest ESG
fund mentioned above. 

Divestment from fossil fuel companies is a trend [fraught with emotion and misconceptions.](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/why-divestment-doesnt-work-and-just-wont-die)
Rather than viewing divestment as a viable theory of change for the energy bedrock of our
economy, Sphere chooses to view companies heavily steeped in O&amp;G to be risky investments.
Sphere's backtraced analysis of the fund shows that the S&amp;P 500 actually performs _better_
without fossil fuel stocks -- it yielded a 199% return over the traditional S&amp;P 500's 178%

Unlike some of the above ESG funds,`$SPFFX` votes your shares in favor of climate.

`$SPFFX` is a _mutual fund_ meaning it can theoretically be invested in from 
company sponsored retirement plans as well as indivial brokerages. Unfortunately, 
the fund is just over a year old and has just shy of $4MM assets under management. 
Many brokerages will refuse to offer funds with so few assets; Charles Schwab will 
only offer funds managing $25MM or more, for example. Guideline's 401k offerings have 
similar restrictions. 

Until Sphere overcomes this barrier to entry they will be available at a limited 
amount of brokerages. Currently,`$SPFFX` is offered through the Vanguard, 
InteractiveBrokers, US Bank, and BNY Mellon.

### The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 Index Fund

The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 ETF (`$VOTE`) is an index fund that passively tracks the
S&amp;P 500 like `$VFIAX`, but differs in how it votes your shares. Because this fund is
passively managed it is able to offer a low 0.05% expense ratio, 1/3rd the expense ratio 
of the cheapest ESG fund mentioned above. 

The contrast between`$VFIAX`'s voting record and `$VOTE`'s voting record is stark. It does 
not proxy your shareholder votes exclusively on climate issues, but that is one of their 
most prominent voting criteria.

Since `$VOTE` invests in the ~500 largest companies in the US, the opportunity for it to vote on 
really impactful proposals _hundreds of times per year_ is not an exaggeration. Most notably, 
`$VOTE` shareholders placed [three members on ExxonMobil's board](https://www.reuters.com/business/little-engine-no-1-beat-exxon-with-just-125-mln-sources-2021-06-29/)
in June 2021 in an effort to shift the corporation's trajectory to something more climate 
friendly.`$VOTE`'s theory of change differs slightly from Sphere's. It recognizes that the S&amp;P 500
contains risky oil and gas assets, but seeks to influence corporate decision making such
that not only the climate benefits, but so do S&amp;P 500 shareholders. 

The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 fund offers a great opportunity to invest in a traditional style
fund with the ancillary benefit of _actually_ steering corporate behavior. Unfortunately, since
it's an ETF and not a mutual fund, you won't find it in any of your workplace sponsored retirement
plans like a 401k, 403b, of 457b.

## Closing Thoughts 

[401k assets totaled over $5.6 Trillion in 2020](https://401kspecialistmag.com/401k-assets-totaled-5-6-trillion-in-first-quarter-2020/).
If even a fraction of that shareholder voting power were proxied in favor of the climate instead of 
against it, I hypothesize that we would be moving _much quicker_ on this unweildy issue. Climate 
change is such a massive problem that it can sometimes feel dizzying to think about all the possible 
solutions humanity can implement. Fortunately, index fund votes have a similar wide reach to the 
climate problem and the associated action is clear-cut: move your money.

Nearly all the points in the resolution are factually incorrect.  

For example, other countries have already implemented versions of a carbon tax, which make it more expensive for us to sell our product in their country.  Without an equivalent tax here, it is cheaper for other countries to export and sell their high carbon products in the US.  This imbalance can ruin our economy, and allow countries like China to create all of the GHG that they want.

More importantly most scientists and policy makers agree that we need a carbon tax to use our market forces to shift demand to products that are lower in carbon content.  Without it we are literally doomed, there is no way to get to net zero.

Here is the list of representatives and how they voted: [Role Call: House Bill Number 86](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202497?)

CALL TO ACTION:  Harass these mother-fkrs!  Follow Trump’s lead and harass their children.  Warn their grandchildren!  Tell them to get serious about dealing with climate change, or get out of the way.

To be clear, I am not calling for abuse or physical harm.  I am asking for a flood of emails and phone calls to the people standing in the way of action on climate.  I’m asking for protests at their local office.   I’m asking for news coverage.  I’m asking that their ignorance and role in dooming the planet does not go unnoticed.

We only need to convince 20 people to change their vote.  20 people to take a step that may save the planet. Dammit.  We can do this.

Scrutiny of China’s coal industry tends to focus on the network of [power plants](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/02/26/china-coal-plant-fossil-fuel-pollution/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) that burn the fossil fuel for energy and release huge amounts of atmosphere-heating carbon dioxide. But the methane seeping from its mines has hampered global efforts to keep planetary warming from reaching even more dangerous levels.

And it helps explain why China — the world’s largest emitter — remains reluctant to set hard limits on the potent greenhouse gas that the International Energy Agency estimates is responsible for [around 30 percent](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2023/understanding-methane-emissions) of global temperature rise since industrialization.

  
Beijing this month released its first plan to curb methane emissions, but didn’t commit to any specific targets, and agreed, [jointly with the United States](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/11/15/china-united-states-climate-change-talks/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8), to triple renewable energy by 2030. While the Biden administration touted the deal as a significant breakthrough, many climate experts consider the statements too weak.

Within the coal industry, China is “the single dominant country” with potential to dramatically reduce emissions, which is why many hoped they would set quantitative targets in the plan, said Drew Shindell, a professor of earth science at Duke University.

Reducing methane, he said, “is the strongest lever for the next few decades to slow down and mitigate the damages from climate change.”

First of all, that's a great question you should be asking yourself too. Are ETF transaction fees and expense ratios low by some act of magic or charity on the part of Wall Street?

There are probably a few mechanisms, but the main ones I would consider are by stock lending, by extracting cash from spreads/volatility as active participants, and by collateralizing higher risk investments.

As long as you are not the directly registered owner of the securities, Wall Street is extracting value from holding them and owing them to you interest-free as a mere entitlement holder.

I'm sure there are better links, but here are a couple I quickly found:

[https://www.ssga.com/uk/en\_gb/institutional/etfs/resources/education/securities-lending](https://www.ssga.com/uk/en_gb/institutional/etfs/resources/education/securities-lending)

&gt;If I can passively “vote” with my money, without much work on my part, I think that’s a win

The VOTE ETF may be unique in trying to provide more transparency (I haven't looked into it), but as mentioned in the first SEC link I shared, votes from entitlement holders are not guaranteed to be counted as there is a complex, unspecified, and opaque system of allocation of oversold shares/voting rights.

"107269","kufvpq5",3,"The strategic shift by corporations like BP and ExxonMobil towards emphasizing individual responsibility in carbon footprint reduction has indeed been critiqued as a deflection from the larger, systemic changes needed to address climate change effectively. By promoting the concept of personal carbon management, these companies aimed to maintain their business models centered around fossil fuel consumption while positioning themselves as part of the solution to a problem they significantly contribute to. This maneuver effectively placed the onus of climate action on individuals, potentially diluting the push for the comprehensive regulatory and systemic reforms required to achieve climate stabilization.

However, the evolution of the carbon market, exemplified by initiatives like the Solaxy Group and its marketplace, presents an innovative approach to engaging individuals directly in climate action. By democratizing access to the carbon market, these platforms offer individuals the opportunity to invest in climate projects, thereby contributing to the generation of carbon credits. This mechanism not only provides necessary funding to vital climate projects but also allows individuals to utilize carbon credits as an asset class, aligning personal financial interests with global sustainability goals.

This model of individual involvement in carbon markets does not negate the importance of systemic change or the need for government intervention to create societies less dependent on fossil fuels. Instead, it complements political and collective action by providing an additional avenue for engagement. By investing in climate projects, individuals can support the transition to a low-carbon economy, demonstrate the viability of sustainable practices, and encourage technological innovation.

Ultimately, the fight against climate change requires a multi-faceted approach that includes individual actions, corporate responsibility, and, crucially, robust government policies. While individual efforts to reduce carbon footprints and invest in climate solutions are valuable, they must be part of a broader strategy that targets the root causes of climate change, demanding accountability from major polluters and implementing systemic changes to reduce global reliance on fossil fuels.","science","2024-03-11 23:02:33","1bc5mp1","Repulsive_Relative_2",0,3,0,"True","2021-01-27 01:41:08",0,0,1615,95,1710,171,"","Human-caused climate change fuels hottest February on record, all-time high ocean warming | ""These anomalously high temperatures are very worrisome ...

Yes of course, you could be a model citizen when it comes to carbon emissions and yes you reducing your carbon footprint makes absolutely no difference in the grand scheme of climate change.

But that’s a surface level view.

Why does taking individual action actually matter?

Because it forces you to learn about climate change. It forces you to learn which sectors are the biggest emitters. It forces you to learn how bad the consequences are going to be if we don’t act. So it makes you informed and able to inform others.

And changing your habits is extremely hard and so if you actually succeed in doing so you’re going to have so much skin in the game.

That’s why sororities and fraternities have initiation ceremonies. The harder it is for you to obtain something, the more you care about it. See Robert Cialdini’s book for further info on this point.

When you have skin in the game, you’re going to feel way more compelled to show up to climate strikes. Way more compelled to vote for parties with the right policies.

And you’re going to talk about climate action at parties, at work, or with your family.

Maybe in a year you convince 20 people to change their habits, and those 20 people convince another 20 people and so on. 

And maybe some of these people you directly or indirectly influenced have high power positions at big companies. And can make big change from inside.

All of a sudden, before you know it, you have in your own way, changed the zeitgeist. 

Corporations and politicians need to keep people pleased in order to maintain power and profit and so if we tell them we are displeased with our wallets and votes, they too will change.

And that starts with having skin in the game. In this sense, your initiation into the world of climate action is arguably starting by tackling your own lifestyle and from there you’re in a position to influence much greater change.","action","2022-01-24 04:54:36","rrg7gc","MDI88",0,2,0,"True","2018-01-19 03:07:55",98,0,516,222,836,283,"With the new year coming in a matter of days, it's a time to reflect on what personal climate action we as individuals can take. Some personal actions are reducing beef consumption, taking the bus to work, less air travel, etc. 

I can't say that people who shop at ""organic"" stores such as Whole Foods are necessarily trying to reduce their carbon footprint, but I imagine that there's more people who shop there that are trying to reduce it on average when compared to other grocery stores.

What you may not realize is that, depending on your store, the item, location, etc, a lot of products could be from across the globe. The pasta section of a Whole Foods grocery store has an overwhelming amount of products that come exclusively from Italy. This may not be an issue if you are in Europe, but it is if you're in North America. Same thing goes for the farmed fish and vegetables, which come from South America and Europe as well. I saw a Bell Pepper from the Netherlands and Sweet Chili Sauce from Thailand. Meanwhile other stores, which aren't marketed as ""organic"" grocery chains will have these products from North America but aren't ""organic.""

One could recharge when tying to the buoy and they could serve as charging points for longer travels. If my electric fishing boat ventured farther from home I could pay you to charge. You in turn could permit me to- rather than some rando - to charge by pairing with my craft and only then would energy flow. 

A distributed “gas station” alleviating range anxiety….

Or dozens in a single current environment that is adjacent to a beautiful view and large ferries etc could stop to admire the view while they refuel - if the voltage transfer were high enough. 

Of course homestead / zero grid living - but you’ve thought of that already.

And marinas selling power they themselves make….. but you’ve thought of that already.

Devastating wildfires are once again raging through various parts of Chile.

If you believe that environmental issues are global issues, that your country can learn from international experience dealing with wildfires, or that international activist collaboration can lead to solutions, then this piece is for you.

After being in the field for 10+ years, I am confident that advocacy for environmental policy reform in Chile is more than possible. Furthermore, international pressure and support have been instrumental in some of our significant successes regarding public policy in Chile.

So, here are three pending bills that people from all around the world can promote to deal with wildfires in Chile:

# 🍂 Bill # 1: Regulates land use in areas that have been burned:

It prohibits real estate companies from building on burnt land for several years.

This eliminates the incentive to set the land on fire.

# 🌲Bill #2: Environmental impact assessment for forestry projects:

Chile has a large forestry industry.

The problem is that the species used and the standards must be updated regarding climate change. Forest plantations need better tools to ensure good territorial planning and firebreaks.

&amp;#x200B;

# 🐜Bill #3: Biodiversity Service:

Lastly, this is the most critical environmental bill in our country.

This bill creates a new state agency dedicated exclusively to caring for native forests but with an ecological and professional look from the 21st century. Today, the agency in charge of biodiversity is still related to business rather than entirely focused on conservation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Do you have such laws in your country?**

**Are you interested in learning how you can support environmental advocacy campaigns in Chile and your own country?**

Fossil fuel companies love to spread articles that make us feel like all hope is lost on the climate. 

The aim is to spread apathy and a mind set along the lines of “why bother trying to phase out fossil, it is too late anyways, we are all doomed no matter what we do now”.

If companies gain too much steam with drawdown tech, they'll invent ways to keep it from being obsolete if we aren't careful. The last thing I want is to go from a fear of increasing atmospheric gases to needing to frantically balance the atmosphere with emitting and drawing down. I want to get back to baseline and then let the planet's ecosystem services drive. We've already got a system that can pretty much cruise control. Then we can stop worrying about it constantly.

The article does not provide details on where the debt comes from. So I assume Cape Verge owes Portugual $X for a business related deal and not pre-colonial debt. 

Cape Verde pays Portugual $X and Portugual according to interntional agreements agrees to put in $Y as support for other nations against climate change. So whether Portugual uses $X from its existing capital or the capital it gets from Cape Verde does not really make a difference? It is after all Portuguals money, right? And it is choosing to put in $X of its total agreeded $Y in support of Cape Verde while $Y - $X can go to any other nation they plan on supporting. 

If we forget the fact that Cape Verde was a Portuguese colony, this should be seen as a positive thing, right? At least positive in the sense that Portugual has an agreement and they are doing something to fulfil it? 

 I'm from a former Portuguese Colony in India as well, the longest continuous European colony in the world, in fact. Adding this info just because I don't want to be seen as ignorant of this matter or insensitive to this fact.

Called the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants Program, it provides more than $250 million in grants, made possible by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, for jurisdictions to develop strategies to reduce their climate pollution. 

These climate action plans also identify new economic opportunities to support clean and green industries, ensure low-income and minorities communities are included in the planning, and support public health benefits gained by reducing various types of environmental pollution.

"129798","kskj9yd",1,"&gt;Majority of oil companies you know right now is investing billion into carbon capture technology ON THEIR OWN

I addressed this. It's green washing. Any carbon they capture is done at source of emissions (high concentrations make it easy) and in service of further extraction and usage of fossil fuels. It's fundamentally net+ GHG emissions. And to capture X amount of fossil fuel emissions, we will need many times more perfectly clean EXCESS energy to recapture it. It's far, far easier and more rational not to emit it in the first place.

&gt;Jeff Bezos himself invest in 10 billions dollars fighting climate change.

How much has he and his companies emitted? It's chump change to him. We should simply tax all that money and invest it ourselves, democratically. 10 Billion is a pittance. The government is already spending orders of magnitude more than that. There is no reason one person should have that many resources and get to decide where they should or should not be invested. It's not a healthy way to structure society.

&gt;Hence why company invest billions dollars to make technologies possible.

Investment isn't magic. New technologies to solve intractable issues are not an inevitability. It's not just a matter of invest more, get more, and keep doing it until you invent the magic solution you actually need.

&gt;You say it is a trick and I do agree but the reality is we also don't have alternative energy source that is efficient enough to maintain current way living.

Precisely! Which is why I sincerely suggest you look into a concept called de-growth. We need to fundamentally re-order society to make things other than perpetual profit and gdp growth our measures of well being. There is more than enough to go around already. You could double the quality of life for billions of people simply by taxing and redistributing the wealth and resources controlled by a handful of people. When the reality of the current course is fundamentally unsustainable, the answer isn't to embrace it and double down while hoping we'll invent magic solutions.

&gt;And reality most people don't want to do that.

Agreed, but don't you think that's kinda what you are doing in insisting that we continue down this path of consumption, making tweaks and adjustments while expecting the free market to solve the problem.

Yes, people, you, me, we are difficult to shake loose from this course of destruction, but that's why we need to start from what SHOULD be happening to have a chance at adequately solving the problem.

How Compatible Are Western European Dietary Patterns to Climate Targets? Accounting for Uncertainty of Life Cycle Assessments by Applying a Probabilistic Approach

Johanna Ruett, Lena Hennes, Jens Teubler, Boris Braun, 03/11/2022

https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/21/14449

&gt;Even if fossil fuel emissions are halted immediately, current trends in global food systems may prevent the achieving of the Paris Agreement’s climate targets.

&gt;All dietary pattern carbon footprints overshoot the 1.5 degrees threshold. The vegan, vegetarian, and diet with low animal-based food intake were predominantly below the 2 degrees threshold. Omnivorous diets with more animal-based product content trespassed them. Reducing animal-based foods is a powerful strategy to decrease emissions.

&gt;The reduction of animal products in the diet leads to drastic GHGE reduction potentials. Dietary shifts to more plant-based diets are necessary to achieve the global climate goals, but will not suffice.

&gt;Our study finds that all dietary patterns cause more GHGEs than the 1.5 degrees global warming limit allows. Only the vegan diet was in line with the 2 degrees threshold, while all other dietary patterns trespassed the threshold partly to entirely.","science","2024-02-26 02:05:39","1azmu00","reyntime",0,6,0,"True","2012-11-17 04:13:10",1894,125,25349,80209,107577,209,"","Earth just experienced its hottest 12 months in recorded history -",0.98,209,0,"2024-02-25 12:31:10"

"115433","ktp04yy",1,"I think you're talking past the article a bit here.   We may be at a one year of 1.4/1.5, and whether that is a new baseline or an anomaly will remain to be seen - but that isn't how it's defined by the IPCC, or Copernicus which is what the author links.   Now, whether the way they measure it with a lagging indicator is the *best* method, or how long of a lag is the best amount, is a different story.  But to pass 1.5c the way that it's discussed and measured today, at or before 2030 seems likely, and accurate.   

I do agree that I don't see a feasible path to 1.5c now, and agree that every bit matters and the sooner we can cut out GHG the better. 

The point of this article, imo, is that our models, predictions and goals are based on a deviation from the 1850 temperature, so the time before that is a different measurement entirely.  If impacts predicted are based on a deviation from a particular baseline, then that wouldn't(or, shouldn't) change if we bump that time back. If we decided tomorrow to now use the 1700 baseline, then it would just change the goals similarly to ""hold warning below 2/2.5 rather than 1.5/2, as the assumed effects wouldn't change.

In that sense I think the article makes sense. At the same time, you seem to be promoting action over complacency, and that is correct too.  The issue with how that study was passed around or phrased is that most people don't read beyond a headline, and would assume it was a 1:1 comparison, which objectively it was not. You touch on this in another comment, where someone talks about moving goal posts (which would actually be by the sponge study rather than IPCC, in this case) so I think you know what the study says and what the current methods and goals are (whether they're sufficient or not) but wanted to add a bit of clarity here as well.","science","2024-03-07 00:34:39","1b72qo4","screendoorblinds",0,1,0,"True","2016-03-20 19:37:35",20,0,202,4946,5168,40,"","Scientists challenge ‘flawed communication’ of study claiming 1.5C warming breach ",0.87,40,0,"2024-03-05 11:10:18"

There are more than one billion acres of previously degraded land where crops can be grown without further imperiling native ecosystems, at no additional cost. Similarly, other companies grow animal feed at large scale without the same levels of water or climate pollution.

There is some sort of corruption that takes place at the Department of Energy that blocks good things from happening whether it is from lobbying groups or something. Demon of bureaucratic chaos – Relates to the phenomenon that ""blocks good things from happening"" at the [United States Department of Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy). This hypothesized entity makes it extremely difficult to complete complex projects — by frequently changing mission requirements, funding, and strategic direction. Examples include the [Mirror Fusion Test Facility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_Fusion_Test_Facility), which was constructed but never turned on; the [Superconducting Super Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_Super_Collider), which cost $2 billion before its cancellation; and [ITER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER), the international fusion experiment in [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France) that the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) has alternately supported and opposed, and to which it has threatened withdrawal, cut funding, and increased funding over the decades.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_(thought_experiment)#cite_note-9)

So when I think of things that need to happen to solve the climate crisis and help average people live sustainably, as people need to live sustainably on top of the structural changes that need to happen. Because the structural things that need to happen partly need to happen to allow your average person to live a sustainable life.

This means, for example, walkable cities, and I'm glad to see reducing car dependency being eliminated as a key way to fight the climate crisis. But something else that needs to happen that I wish more people would talk about involves where Food and the various other things that we use in our lives, (Clothes, Shoes, electronics, etc. ) are made.

Earth at risk: An urgent call to end the age of destruction and forge a just and sustainable future
https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/4/pgae106/7638480

“Abstract

Human development has ushered in an era of converging crises: climate change, ecological destruction, disease, pollution, and socioeconomic inequality. 

This review synthesizes the breadth of these interwoven emergencies and underscores the urgent need for comprehensive, integrated action. 

Propelled by imperialism, extractive capitalism, and a surging population, we are speeding past Earth's material limits, destroying critical ecosystems, and triggering irreversible changes in biophysical systems that underpin the Holocene climatic stability which fostered human civilization. 

The consequences of these actions are disproportionately borne by vulnerable populations, further entrenching global inequities. 

Marine and terrestrial biomes face critical tipping points, while escalating challenges to food and water access foreshadow a bleak outlook for global security. 

Against this backdrop of Earth at risk, we call for a global response centered on urgent decarbonization, fostering reciprocity with nature, and implementing regenerative practices in natural resource management. 

We call for the elimination of detrimental subsidies, promotion of equitable human development, and transformative financial support for lower income nations. 

A critical paradigm shift must occur that replaces exploitative, wealth-oriented capitalism with an economic model that prioritizes sustainability, resilience, and justice. 

We advocate a global cultural shift that elevates kinship with nature and communal well-being, underpinned by the recognition of Earth’s finite resources and the interconnectedness of its inhabitants. 

The imperative is clear: to navigate away from this precipice, we must collectively harness political will, economic resources, and societal values to steer toward a future where human progress does not come at the cost of ecological integrity and social equity.”

This detail packed review paper by a bevy of distinguished authors does not hold back any punches. Urgent language details how dire our present situation is, and provided a glimmer of hope on what society must do to have any chance of pulling back from the precipice where we are today.

Lower the temperature of water from 0.000001 C to 0.0000001 C and it is still liquid water. Then lower the temperature again the same fraction of a degree and it has a profound change of state from a liquid to a solid. Not only that, but the density of the solid is less(!!!!!) than the density of the liquid, allowing life to survive on our planet.

Another really fascinating phase transition is from a normal metal to a superconductor. Lowering the temperature of certain metals, which have resistance (albeit small) to the flow of electrons (electrical current) can result in a phase transition to a zero resistance superconductor state. Not close to zero resistance, but actually exactly zero resistance. 

When physicists do their physicist things, they can treat our transition from the Holocene Era to the Anthropocene Era as a phase transition.

As a result, they build theoretical models to study this transition, and these models build on superconductor models using Logistic Maps, lots of impressive equations, and something called Ginsburg-Landau theory.

What they find is that it is theoretically possible for the climate state of the Earth to transition from our present state to a state of utter chaotic behaviour; literally a state of chaos.

We probably don’t want this to happen, but that seems to be where we are headed.

""Specifically, 80–90% of Americans underestimate the prevalence of support for major climate change mitigation policies and climate concern.

As expected, climate change deniers and climate change believers will debate endlessly in the comment section, with both sides bringing their arguments, resources, study, data, etc. While I personally know where I stand, I wonder how much impact these arguments are to undecided folks. As far as I can see, often the deniers will bring in resources that may seem legit until someone actually dig deeper and call out the flaw. Unfortunately often those remain unchallenged.  This makes the ""undecideds"" keep on having a status quo because ""they don't know what's right anymore"", or worse: they'd believe the deniers' arguments more. 

I wonder if there should be a more concerted effort to:

1. Report any new posts and the comments in that post that may be potentially misleading. 
2. Reply with fact checks and call out misleading arguments.
3. Build a crowdsourced website, keep on updating a list of frequent arguments by the deniers,  and counterargument with proper citations. Needless to say this has to be unbiased to maintain credibility. We can then start pointing to this website as part of the counterargument. 
4. Regarding credibility: it would be even better if some of the maintainers of this website are scientists and economists. (Economists involvements are important because some group of people always think in terms of economic tradeoffs).

I'm also looking into the Time-of-Use-Pricing option.  I have an EV, and I can save about 50% by charging my car over night.  Costs are higher during the day, so I'm currently analyzing my usage to see if this will work out; it looks good so far.

This is a positive action you can take and it is something you can do daily, weekly. monthly and more. As we all have a set amount of time/money we can put into action, I’m arguing this is the best place for it.

A few caveats before I start on the why and how of my argument here.

*First* does not need to be the only thing you do, if you’re doing other things and they are working for you, great, I am also going to say it is work putting some time into politics. If you’ve got limited free time because of work/family etc - this is IMHO the best place to put energy.

*Second,* I’m assuming as the reader you’re in a political system where you can influence the outcome. The main examples I’ll use here are from Uk and the US as that is what I know about. Would always be interested to read other’s points of view.

*Third*, I’m not saying if you’re not doing what I’m arguing that somehow you’re bad - not at all - if you’re doing something - anything - towards climate solutions that is always better than doing nothing.

OK let’s get into it. It has been apparent that humanity has needed to act for decades on climate. Year after year passes and yet the kind of meaningful global action we need to see does not come to pass. I’m not going to spell out the worrying situation we’re in, as plenty of others do so and very well. Over that time we’ve seen a plethora of different groups, tactics, actions over a range of different countries come to pass and yet nothing meaningful has changed. This is not an implicit criticism of all of those that have gone before, indeed I’ve taken part in plenty of them. It is simply an acknowledgement that the scale of the challenge is huge and getting action done is hard. But at its core, we need governments to act.

This is both a realistic and achievable course of action; as well as the huge rise in renewables, plus the fact that most people favour climate action, there are also solutions that are popular with voters and don’t cost taxpayers money - indeed they save us money - such as removing fossil fuel subsidies.

Our issue is the gap between these solutions and where we are now and what we need in the coming years. That gap is about political will.

How do we close it? 

We can help by making our up-coming climate action political. How? The theory here is pretty basic:

1. Find the next election of note to where you vote - local, national etc.
2. Find the politician there who has both a good chance of winning and who is better on climate issues.
3. Back the better climate candidate to win. This is where you can take meaningful action - volunteer for the campaign, donate to the campaign, advocate for them online and so on. Make sure that they know that your support comes from them having a better climate position than the other possible victor in the race.
4. If they win, keep the pressure up on them to enact promises of climate action by writing to them to remind them of why they had your support. Whenever a big legislative vote on an item of climate legislation is coming up, write to them to ask if they will support it. Write to them to encourage them to go further on climate issues. 
5. While that is happening. find the next election you can vote in. Repeat.
6. When there is no upcoming election - write to your incumbent representative on climate issues, even if they are not great on it, so they know people do care.

That’s it. That’s the strategy.

So I’m based in the UK - next up for us is the local elections on May 2nd. This is for local councils and some other seats like police commissioner and some mayors. Then later in 2024 (no date as yet) will be the national elections where we vote to a Member of Parliament (MPs) and the party with the most MPs goes on to form a government.

***Some notes on it.***

This is not some silver bullet for climate action, I know. It is more like the Atomic Habits version where we’re focused on small but meaningful gains that over time, however they do become bigger and more potent the more we win.

It also means compromises. A lot of it. Politics is about compromise and all too often, picking the lesser of two evils. It is sad but real. It means there will be other issues in the campaign that perhaps you don’t agree with, yes not great, but getting climate solutions enacted is about being pragmatic at this stage.

On what candidates/party? Again, its about being pragmatic. For example, what if there are other candidates/parties who are really good on climate but don’t really have a chance of winning? Sadly I don’t think that is the best place for our energy. We need climate policies enacted now and we need governments who will respond to the inevitable climate disasters by going further on climate action. Which means you need to get people elected first. 

What if there are no candidates talking about climate issues at all? You can go to political town halls and hustings and ask them. Contact the campaigns to ask? Put our climate on the agenda. Still not happening for you? Possibly even join the better climate policy party in your area which has a chance of victory and stand for election, running on climate as ***the*** issue for you.

What about the sense that all politicians are the same and the system seems broken. Totally agree with that sentiment, however there is a huge difference, in climate terms, between a party that will do something and a party that not only denies that the issue exists but will actively aim to make things worse. I’d rather have big ambitious gains on climate policy, but if the alternative is between small gains and denial, I’ll take the small gains.

Ideally if you can find others in the area with the same concerns and act as a group of voters, the better! Plus there are always things you can do in a political campaign from online advocacy to campaign volunteering. One of the best things to offset feeling scared for the future, is to act for a better future - to borrow a slogan; Do More, Worry Less.

(Again, please don’t mean me saying not to worry as much as saying I don’t worry at all - I do - it's just that beyond the point of motivation for action worry can just sap energy and morale.)

Distribution seems like the hardest part of hydrogen which is worse than all of the other options: it's certainly not cheaper than electricity, especially if you're talking about green hydrogen which is electrolyzed and needs electricity anyway, taking a massive efficiency hit.

It needs all new distribution infrastructure to be built, even if you're electrolyzing hydrogen on-site at airports and distributing it to planes.

All of that distribution infrastructure needs to be leakproof too, as fugitive hydrogen is a positive radiative forcing.

Comparative habitability of the Earth, Venus and Mars in the young solar system.
Nisbet, E. G.
Abstract
Abstract To be habitable, a planet must be suitable at all scales [1]. The setting in relation to the star must be right, so that surface temperatures can sustain liquid water. The planetary inventory must be suitable, providing surface water, rocks, and accessible thermodynamic disequilibrium. There must be physical habitat, especially mud and hydrothermal systems around volcanoes. Planets are not static: they evolve. Habitability must evolve with the planet. On accretion, the processes of impact and formation of volatile inventory must be suitable. Tectonics and volcanism must supply redox contrasts and biochemical substrates capable not only of starting life but of sustaining it. Mud or soft sediment may be essential: it is unlikely that early life can sustain itself in open water or air. This requirement for mud has tectonic implications. Once life starts, it immediately alters its own environment, by consuming nutrient. Until photosynthesis evolves, inorganic sources must supply sustained redox contrast to the local environment. But life changes its setting, both by risky alterations to the atmospheric greenhouse (drawing down CO2, emitting CH4), and by partitioning reductants (e.g. as dead bodies) and oxidants (waste). Somehow the planet must avoid both freezing and boiling. Early in the history of the solar system, a passing galactic tourist might have rated Venus as the likeliest habitat for life, Mars next, and Earth last of the three. Venus was warm and hospitable, Mars clement, and Earth had been though an impact episode powerful enough to make a silicate atmosphere. By comparison with Earth there are many potential environmental settings on Mars in which life may once have occurred, or may even continue to exist. Perhaps Mars seeded earth? Yet today the reverse order of habitability is the case. Earth today is safeguarded by a reworked atmosphere that is 99% of biological construction, maintained in active disequilibrium with the surface. Mars, in contrast, is chilly oxidised permafrost where kinetics alone would make life difficult. Venus has achieved sustainable equilibrium, where equilibrium, being the opposite of life, equals death. Geologically, how and why did this happen? Earth was not necessarily the Goldilocks planet, neither too warm not too cold.","Comparative habitability of the Earth, Venus and Mars in the young solar system. - NASA/ADS",0.81,3,0,"2024-02-06 00:47:55"
"375102","k6xop5s",1,"Yes, I care about the climate, but I'm a result oriented realist, and as such I try to look for solutions that will have an effect and warn against ""solutions"" that either have diminishing effects or are so unrealistic that they will never be implemented in reality.

In a way that has made me a pessimist - I don't see how we'll be able to dodge a fairly drastic increase in global temperatures, and I'd like the debate to shift more towards **how** to implement measures to decrease GHG (we already have plenty of ideas of *what* to do), aswell as how to **prepare for the inevitable changes** (preventive damage control).

With that said, I'm generally against drastic ""complete ban of X"" solutions, as they are extremely difficult to enforce - especially on a global scale - and they have a very high probability of messing up other things (this is especially true for questions related to animals,  plants and foods). Plus they *always* lead to polarization, hate and conflicts, which can backfire quite badly.

I agree that in several countries (not all) there is a clear over-consumption of meat products, but instead of a complete ban I'd rather see efforts to reduce consumption to more reasonable and sustainable levels (e.g. 100-200 years ago, most people didn't eat meat for long periods, but they weren't vegans either).","science","2023-10-29 10:18:49","17gk77q","DanAnderzzon",0,1,0,"True","2023-10-02 11:51:24",0,0,2,1737,1739,167,"","Time to treat the climate and nature crisis as one indivisible global health emergency",0.99,167,0,"2023-10-26 00:49:27"

Recalling the Manhattan Project, he stated that the goal of Project Independence was to achieve energy self-sufficiency for the United States by 1980, through a national commitment to energy conservation and development of alternative sources of energy. Nixon declared that American science, technology and industry could free America from its dependence on imported oil, and establish its energy independence.

Elmendorf writes. “Last month, a broad coalition of congressional Democrats released their vision for how to do this. Their bill, the Clean Electricity and Transmission Acceleration Act, includes many good ideas, such as clarifying the federal government’s authority to approve interstate transmission lines, requiring public utilities to account for the ‘social cost of carbon’ in setting rates, and addressing a shortage of electrical transformers.

“But then the bill undermines itself by setting up a succession of legal obstacles. This will allow NIMBY neighbors, fossil-fuel front groups, and other opponents of vital infrastructure to drag out the permitting process for years by concocting one procedural objection after another.

“Many environmentalists, civic groups, and sympathetic lawmakers fail to recognize that demanding too much community input and legal review has a downside. But the consequences are evident in San Francisco ... In addressing the climate crisis, the U.S. does not have the luxury of time.”

Sea-level rise submerges terrestrial permafrost in the Arctic, turning it into subsea permafrost. Subsea permafrost underlies \~ 1.8 million km^(2) of Arctic continental shelf, with thicknesses in places exceeding 700 m. Sea-level variations over glacial-interglacial cycles control subsea permafrost distribution and thickness, yet no permafrost model has accounted for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), which deviates local sea level from the global mean due to changes in ice and ocean loading. Here we incorporate GIA into a pan-Arctic model of subsea permafrost over the last 400,000 years. Including GIA significantly reduces present-day subsea permafrost thickness, chiefly because of hydro-isostatic effects as well as deformation related to Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Additionally, we extend the simulation 1000 years into the future for emissions scenarios outlined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report. We find that subsea permafrost is preserved under a low emissions scenario but mostly disappears under a high emissions scenario.""","science","2024-04-17 00:12:48","1c5vqr8","screendoorblinds",0,1,0,"True","2016-03-20 19:37:35",20,0,202,4946,5168,4,"","Glacial isostatic adjustment reduces past and future Arctic subsea permafrost",0.84,4,0,"2024-04-17 00:12:11"

General news-release article: https://phys.org/news/2024-03-enormous-ice-loss-greenland-glacier.html

Peer-reviewed scientific paper article:
https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/18/1333/2024/tc-18-1333-2024.pdf

Ground based on-ice measurements, airborne survey measurements, and satellite measurements are verified against each other, and show how fast this 79NG glacier is thinning, moving, and melting. 

This glacier is quickly withering away due to the onslaught of extremely high air temperatures melting the surface of the glacier creating numerous glacial lakes on the surface, which are drilling through the ice draining the water to the bedrock below and into the ocean. 

Just as significant for the ice melt, the warming oceans below are greatly accelerating the basal ice melt (ice at the bottom of the floating parts of the glacier in contact with ocean water). In fact, near the center line longitudinal cross section of the ice, a 500 meter high cavity has been melted into the bottom of the glacier, and this cavity of upside down crevice has come to within 190 meter of the glacier surface. 

When it penetrates through the surface, the glacier will likely cleave into two parts, and what often happens is the whole thing shatters into a multitude of smaller pieces that quickly cascade out into the ocean and quickly melt out.

Overall, the thickness of the glacier has decreased by 160 meters, but that is outside of the 500 meter cavity region, but it seems to me that the ice over the cavity region is by far the weakest spot or Achilles Heel of the whole thing.

Not good…

What do with expect, with fossil fuel production at record highs, and at record acceleration rates? 

We need to expect chaos.

I want to see what ideas you have. I am writing this from a US-based perspective.

I have the good fortune that I am able to save up money from my paycheck towards retirement. I am hoping to find a productive way for these funds to help fight climate change. I am looking for your suggestions on how to do this.  


While donating to charities would be an option, I can only do so much of this before I would put my retirement in jeopardy. An ideal solution would have some sort of positive return while also helping to fund a positive impact in the world. Maximizing the positive return, however, is not a requirement. Rather, I prefer to maximize the impact.  


The most common answer I see is to buy stocks or ETFs of companies helping to fight climate change. I have a problem with this because I don't believe that purchasing the stock of such companies actually helps them magnify their positive impact in any way.  


What I'm hoping for is a platform where I can loan out money to help individuals or organizations to purchase renewable energy (such as solar PVs) that may not otherwise be able to afford it/have access to it. I have come across something similar that Canadians can invest in, but nothing like this for Americans.  


I welcome your collective wisdom.

Thank you all,

* You'll have to tell your children that they can no longer go outside in the summer.
* You'll have to live in constant fear of storms that could destroy your homes, crops and livelihood. 
* (Your favorite hobby) will get more expensive and/or harder to come by.
* Bring up the disasters this year - how much was lost and how it could happen to you.  


Other things we can do:

* If you're in a bank that funds fossil fuels, threaten to take your money to another bank or credit union. Encourage others to do the same
* Publicly vilify fossil fuel suits. Not just executives, but also **their lobbyists and lawyers** who corrupt our laws. Turn them into public pariahs who are responsible for destroying our homes, food and livelihood.

"184586","kkat5p3",1,"There is a BIG difference between mass protests and civil disobedience vs. going to a random museum and throwing soup at an artwork. 

You've got the relative value of those two activities *backwards.*  Yes, mass protests are disruptive, but at least they demonstrate clearly that there are a lot of people who feel strongly about an issue -- and that's something that can drive real change.  Better, they can directly disrupt the business of carbon emitters -- and that costs them real money and reduces emissions. 

A couple people going out and doing a stupid stunt only shows that there are people willing to do stupid stunts.  It's easy for the public to ignore them, or laugh at what they care about.  We live in the social media age, we see people doing stupid stunts all the time. 

&gt; We stopped a coal power plant for good and it barely got into national news a decade ago

Which is precisely my point here: that's a huge positive outcome, and actually accomplished something.   That's a massive amount of carbon that *won't* be emitted. 

Don't confuse media coverage ""attention"" with real results. Media coverage CAN be useful in some cases, but only when it leads to positive outcomes.

Show me: where exactly did attacking artworks cause a fossil fuel powerplant or pipeline to get shut down?  Where did it lead to the deployment of renewable energy?  Where did it directly reduce emissions?

Wide-scale actions grow out of individual action, and class action has historically made transformative changes.

Then the system broke. 

Since then, there have been three years of record low sea ice and two years of very high sea ice; basically variability or whiplashing has more than doubled.

The major problem for the global climate is that with record low sea ice formation and record low sea ice area circumventing Antarctica, there is much less dense water created from salt rejection as sea ice forms. Thus, less water sinks to the abyss, in fact over 30% less in the Weddell Sea; thus formation of Antarctica Bottom Water (AABW) is reduced about 15%. This slows the Global Meridional Overturning Circulation (Global MOC) and has profound effects on global climate stability.

Very serious indeed. 

There are also many problems local to Antarctica as well, such as enhanced wave action erosion (melting) and calving of ice sheets, disruptions to phytoplankton, mass mortality of emperor penguins, to name a few. 

However, by far the most profound and far-reaching problem is the MOC reduction and global climate instability, with cascading feedbacks much more likely.

“Slowdown of Antarctic Bottom Water export driven by climatic wind and sea-ice changes”:
Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is pivotal for oceanic heat and carbon sequestrations on multidecadal to millennial timescales. The Weddell Sea contributes nearly a half of global AABW through Weddell Sea Deep Water and denser underlying Weddell Sea Bottom Water that form on the continental shelves via sea-ice production. Here we report an observed 30% reduction of Weddell Sea Bottom Water volume since 1992, with the largest decrease in the densest classes. This is probably driven by a multidecadal reduction in dense-water production over southern continental shelf associated with a greater than 40% decline in the sea-ice formation rate…”:

“Observational Evidence for a Regime Shift in Summer Antarctic Sea Ice”: In recent years, the Southern Ocean has experienced extremely low sea ice cover in multiple summers. These low events were preceded by a multidecadal positive trend that culminated in record high ice coverage in 2014. This abrupt transition has led some authors to suggest that Antarctic sea ice has undergone a regime shift… We find that the standard deviation of the summer sea ice record has doubled from 0.31 million km2 in 1979–2006 to 0.76 million km2 for 2007–22. This increased variance is accompanied by a longer season-to-season sea ice memory. The atmosphere is the primary driver of Antarctic sea ice variability, but using a linear predictive model we show that sea ice changes cannot be explained by the atmosphere alone. Identifying whether a regime shift has occurred is difficult without a complete understanding of the physical mechanism of change. However, the statistical changes that we demonstrate (i.e., increased variance and autocor- relation, and a changed response to atmospheric forcing), as well as the increased spatial coherence noted by previous re- search, are indicators based on dynamical systems theory of an abrupt critical transition. Thus, our analysis is further evidence in support of a changed Antarctic sea ice system.”:

Hey,

I’m Maddie, a university student from the UK, and one of the youth committee from #0beef.

Want to join us in taking urgent action to combat climate change ? We’re reaching out to find a few select students to join our campaign and make a real difference within their Universities.

Did you know that your canteen could cut its emissions by 40% per year with just a few simple
menu changes in their menu? - that’s the carbon equivalent of 136 024 economy class return air
journeys between London and New York every year.

Thanks to the experience we have working with institutions like the University of Cambridge,
and schools like North London Collegiate School and Eltham Hill School in Greenwich, we can
help to guide your canteen and service staff in the transition.- but we need your help to get the
movement started.

We’d love to be able to help to make it easy for you to make a major positive impact on your
university's carbon footprint. Check out our website to find out more.(0beef.com).

If you’d like to lend a hand to grow this campaign, drop me a message either on here, or on Instagram (@0beef) so we can set up a call :)

NYC has about 11000 sq ft per person, and is a decent huge city for reference. If the sun produces 44000 vs gas 365, gas is about .8% of the total heat, likely a little higher as NYC gets less sun than some areas. Maybe a single degree of heat cooler per my math and adding your 22000mBTU per sq ft","action","2022-08-25 02:18:29","wv7ndw","bricklayerguy",0,1,0,"True","2019-07-15 02:38:34",0,0,55,124,179,35,"Air conditioning is a bandaid on cancer to cool hot cities, creating some cool areas and some extremely hot areas. In order to effectively decrease the temperature of cities to make them more efficient habitats for humanity (thereby decreasing sprawl and energy consumption) it may be useful to eliminate heat waste directly. It seems self evident that the first place to start with elimination of excess heat waste is to stop burning stuff, aka a Gasoline Free City.

For what it's worth, I am also interested in various measures to mitigate solar heat, as that is the primary factor in earth surface temperature. Wind and water circulation are the primary methods of negating extremes, so could be helpful, but reducing the actual burning of a relatively inert substance (gasoline) in a place you want to live seems efficient.

Stats seem to indicate the US burns 370 million gallons of gas and 130 million gallons of diesel. If Toyota is proud of occasionally hitting 41% thermal efficiency with their engines (best for autos) then at best we are dealing with roughly 50%  thermal efficiency on 500 million gallons of petroleum products in the US (excluding av gas and heating oil). For simple math estimate 120,000 BTUs per gallon. Means 30 trillion BTUs. That means 1 million BTUs per person. Given how effectively the environment disperses heat it is tough to determine how that would change the microclimate of the city- as tough as predicting weather. Is there any practical way to estimate the effect burning gas has on the city's microclimate?

tldr: burning stuff makes the city hot, decreasing burning in cities could be very effective. Is there a way to measure this?","Gasoline Free City",0.93,35,0,"2022-08-22 22:44:51"

However, I do think **there must be better ways how we can organize financially** and come together as a voice for climate, not just a voice that vocalizes our dissent with the status quo. It's clear that our governments and big corporations are not acting fast enough for us to stay on track to our Net Zero goals and to avoid a complete ecological disaster.

**I'm trying to get an important conversation going here**: 

Do you have any thoughts / business ideas for how to create a product mechanism that will allow all of us to contribute a small amount financially to climate? 

I'm thinking, it would be a small sacrifice on an individual level, but together we could harness $$ billions to real climate causes overlooked by investors / governments, those that need it the most! 

For instance, the team behind [Australian Seaweed Institute](https://www.australianseaweedinstitute.com.au/) has developed a novel, cutting edge technology to protect the Great Barrier Reef from more climate damage, but they are having difficulty attracting much-needed funds from the government &amp; commercial climate investors to carry out the 5-10 technology deployment program.

Other items outlined in the plan include managing 3.4 million acres of croplands for healthy soils, drought resilience and below-ground biodiversity, as well as conservation. This includes about 152,000 acres per year by 2030; 206,000 acres per year by 2038, and 209,500 acres per year by 2045.

CONCORD, N.H. — Birch syrup? Beech? Walnut? Sycamore?



Maple trees — and the sap that flows through them — reign supreme for syrup-making in New England.



But [with a record-warm winter](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/03/08/metro/warmest-winter-us-on-record/#:~:text=Boston%20and%20Providence%20experienced%20their,since%20records%20began%20in%201872.?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), some maple syrup producers have seen a decline in their production this year. The season got underway earlier than usual in the southern part of the state, and there were several stretches where the temperature did not go below freezing, which maples need in order for their sap to flow.



So David Moore, a researcher and Ph.D. student at the University of New Hampshire is drilling down to find what it takes to [make syrup](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/travel/2019/03/19/how-make-your-own-maple-syrup/YUEarecDOf6dvXe37XBf6O/story.html?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) from [sap from other trees](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/2018/04/09/move-over-maple-birch-syrup-takes-root/2uyT0l34mnEExVRZaIX30I/story.html?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link).

Moore believes tapping other types of trees holds both an economic and environmental promise for the region as it grapples with [climate change](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/12/19/business/maple-syrup-inspired-97-year-old-entrepreneur-robert-macarthur-act-climate-change/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link).



“A bad maple year may not be a bad birch year,” he said. “From a farmer’s perspective, it’s kind of like diversifying your portfolio.”

And there’s an economic incentive: Birch syrup, for example, can sell for four to 10 times the price of maple syrup.

While scientists have a good understanding of sap flow in maples, Moore said little is known what causes it to flow in other types of trees. His work is focused on both the physiology of the trees and practical applications like best management practices, how harvest the sap, and how to to boil sap down to syrup.","science","2024-03-19 17:48:22","1biqdyy","bostonglobe",0,1,0,"True","2017-11-07 17:36:41",392,0,111432,43797,155621,5,"","Move over maple?

Morrisey called the SEC’s rule “a back door move to undermine the energy industry.”

The move comes even though the Securities and Exchange Commission’s regulations do not contain what had been one of the more controversial provisions: a requirement to disclose so-called Scope 3 emissions from indirect sources such as consumers or supply chain providers.""

I think it’s debatable whether small reductions are beneficial, given that we will initiate feedbacks that will overpower any emissions reduction if we don’t radically de-grow emissions within the near future. But whatever. It is obviously good to reduce emissions. 

And those victims are partly why I care about this. People in Bangladesh will never praise us for being civil, following procedure, protecting the constitution.

Solar hot water systems: These systems use solar panels to heat water, reducing or eliminating the need for electricity or gas. They are most effective in areas with plenty of sunshine and can provide significant energy savings over time.
  

  
Heat pump water heaters: These systems use electricity to move heat from the air or ground to heat water. They can be more energy-efficient than traditional electric water heaters, especially in areas with mild to moderate climates.
  

  
Tankless water heaters: These systems heat water on demand, rather than storing hot water in a tank. They can be more energy-efficient than tank-style water heaters, as they do not have to continuously heat and reheat water.
  

  
High-efficiency gas water heaters: These systems use gas to heat water, but are designed to be more energy-efficient than traditional gas water heaters. They can be a good option for homes that do not have access to solar or electric hot water systems.
  

  
When selecting a climate-conscious hot water system, it is important to consider your specific climate, usage patterns, and budget. You may want to consult with a professional plumber or contractor to determine the best option for your home. Additionally, many utility companies offer rebates or incentives for energy-efficient hot water systems, which can help offset the upfront cost of installation.","action","2023-03-14 07:34:16","113fm4t","UpfrontPlumbing",0,2,0,"True","2022-09-26 09:40:14",0,0,1,2,3,22,"We (2 seniors, semi-retired) have to update our hot water heater- present 40 gal. short tank gas system is 14 yrs. old, also looking at the HW heating system for a change in the coming years as well...suggestions?","Best climate conscious hot water system?",0.94,22,0,"2023-02-16 02:27:15"

It just feels like there’s no possibility of protests reaching the same intensity compared to 2019. I’ve tried joining advocacy groups at my university but they just… don’t do anything.

Well hello again you complicit arsehole. What’s this, you’ve had a good day? Why? What kind of day can be good when we’re circling climate collapse? If you had any kind of good day, you’re completely ignoring the problem. Ta da! You’re complicit. So, what did you do then? Oh, you’re visiting youre family in italy? Your family drove here? (Im M17) wow, even then, how ignorant can you be? Every car journey is bringing collapse even closer, and it’s youre fault for not calling it out. So what do you normally do when you’re back in your own country? Hm? Trainspotting? Birthday? Fun? How dare you, how absolutely dare you. Trains still emmit carbon, youre whitnessing and complicitly overseeing the death of many just so you can get your stupid little train fix. So your birthday is soon, you’re 18? Well don’t bother celebrating, there’s no point. You’ve no future and it’s selfish to even think you do. Remember, hope is complicity, hope is selfishness, if you accept you’ll die horribly and become miserable you’ll finally be accepted as a climate aware person. Any kind of positive emotion right now is just a sign of your disgusting complicity. Doom is coming, and you have to commit yourself to it right now, or why bother even trying… to live. If you don’t, you’re just as complicit and oblivious as the corporations, as the deniers, as the lawmakers. So, what are you gonna do tomorrow, eh? Complicitly let your dad drive you somewhere while you say nothing? Play games on your laptop that draws deadly power? Continue complicitly enjoying your silly little vacation? No amounts of family comfort, of them saying “we’re in this together”, will make you any more favourable. You should have converted them to a completely net zero family by now. Oh, you’re trying? Well try harder. So, what about your more immediate future, eh? Whats that? You want to go to university in September? Youve just crossed a massive line, an education? Really? How about you educate yourself on how complicit you’re being, going to a uni, shame on you. Ignore what people say, you’re not ‘being hard on yourself’, this is the truth. Now go to sleep, and you’re a menace to society, never forget that.

    - Each game begins in the year 2010, and the player has 50 years to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions as agreed upon at ""World Summits"", which take place every five years beginning in 2015. The world summits also determine how aid is distributed to promote emission reductions. The player starts with a region containing only cities in which he constructs such buildings as mines, power plants, and businesses. There is a finite number of locations in which buildings can be placed, requiring careful planning. Along with reducing emissions, the player must also balance the production and consumption of electricity, water, food and garbage while sustaining the economy.[2]","action","2022-12-09 22:33:31","z64r1x","Jimstein",0,1,0,"True","2013-02-14 13:12:24",998,801,4100,3239,9138,42,"Please use this thread to post your current Climate Action oriented discussions and any other concerns or comments about climate change action in general.

Today there’s a forest fire near where I live. I try not to think about it, but people around me bring it up and it just makes me more stressed out about the climate situation. Along with hurricanes and the unusually warm temperatures this October, I just feel like no matter what we do to control it, climate change always has something to undermine the efforts to combat the worsening situation, or even uproot them. The demand of fossil fuels is supposed to be coming very soon this decade, but I have the opinion that before then, more extreme weather events are going to happen that will inflict damage not just on homes, but on places like wind farms and solar plants.

I'm in the midst of a 1.5 year project/struggle to get a new photovoltaic system with batteries installed on my home. The permitting process in Los Angeles county is arduous, slow, bureaucratic. In addition, just getting all the disparate components to work together is technically challenging. Lastly, a complete solar system is expensive. It shouldn't really be this way.

I drive a Smart car, avg MPG around 44, up and down a 2000 foot hill. I'm looking at a plugin-hybrid or maybe pure electric but am concerned about range, charging station availability and overall cost.

Greta Thunberg is brilliant and amazing. She certainly gains attention towards the cause. But it seems the captains of industry coldly stare down on her from their piles of cash and utter a collective yawn. The only thing which is guaranteed to get their attention is to disturb their cash pile. Disrupting the imput stream seems the most obvious method. But boycotts are only effective with enough participants.

One way to do this, the report suggests, is solar geoengineering. This controversial technology aims to cool temperatures by reflecting sunlight away from the Earth, or allowing more heat to escape into space. That can be done through injecting aerosols into the atmosphere or spraying clouds with salt particles to make them more reflective, for example.

We are really playing a fools game.

Report: “Emissions Gap Report 2023
Broken Record
Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again)”

Key Messages from Report 

1. Global GHG emissions set new record of 57.4 GtCO2e in 2022

2. Current and historical emissions are highly unequally distributed within and among countries, reflecting global patterns of inequality

3. There has been negligible movement on NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) since COP 27, but some progress in NDCs and policies since the Paris Agreement was adopted

4. The number of net-zero pledges continues to increase, but confidence in their implementation remains low

5. The emissions gap in 2030 remains high: current unconditional NDCs imply a 14 GtCO2e gap for a 2°C goal and a 22 GtCO2e gap for the 1.5°C goal. The additional implementation of the conditional NDCs reduces these estimates by 3 GtCO2e

6. Action in this decade will determine the ambition required in the next round of NDCs for 2035, and the feasibility of achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement

7. If current policies are continued, global warming is estimated to be limited to 3°C. Delivering on all unconditional and conditional pledges by 2030 lowers this estimate to 2.5°C, with the additional fulfilment of all net-zero pledges bringing it to 2°C

8. The failure to stringently reduce emissions in high-income countries and to prevent further emissions growth in low- and middle-income countries implies that all countries must urgently accelerate economy-wide, low-carbon transformations to achieve the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement

9. Low- and middle-income countries face substantial economic and institutional challenges in low-carbon energy transitions, but can also exploit opportunities

10. Further delay of stringent global GHG emissions reductions will increase future reliance on CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) to meet the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement

In a nutshell, this UN report documents the gap between emissions and what is needed to slow, let alone halt accelerated global warming from the United Nations perspective. I am bringing it to your attention, but as you and I both know, things are much worse than depicted, and worsening at an accelerating rate. 

The UN has slowly realized that we need to remove carbon from the atmosphere and the oceans (CDR). What they do not yet realize is that we also need to utilize large scale Solar Radiation Management (SRM) to cool the planet, but I am guessing they will eventually come to this point of view, hopefully sooner rather than later

Agreed. So maybe this was also still a contributing factor in the EU aswell?

&gt;Would Japan and South Korea react as well to being cut off, and by an ""ally"" to boot?

I think that all the nations without domestic fossil fuel consumption ramp up their efforts to reduce their dependencies on it. I also think that's the main reason why Europe peaked fossil fuel consumption in its primary energy back in 1979. It was still more profitable to import the fuels, but without larger domestic production there was at least *some* desire to limit the use of fossil fuels. However, with economic realities shifting, the attractiveness of alternatives increased, and [Russia now put a national security aspect on it](https://rethinkdisruption.com/energy-disruption-russia-ukraine-accelerate/). It still takes time to reduce dependencies, but I'd hope that this reduction now actually gets faster than in the last decade.

From the linked blog article:

&gt;In short, Russia’s actions are self-flagellating in the long-run. They are accelerating the decline of its core industries and their loss of market share, while accelerating the clean energy disruption.
&gt;
&gt;This is reflected in how Europe is responding so far. Germany has taken the extraordinary step of bringing forward its net zero renewable energy targets, aiming to meet all its electricity needs from solar and wind sources by 2035 – 15 years earlier than previously envisaged.
&gt;
&gt;Germany has also announced plans to spend $216 billion over the next four years on building out an electric vehicle charging network, promoting hydrogen fuel, and introducing climate protection measures. The EU similarly plans to diversify gas supplies while boosting renewables, expanding electrification and quadrupling targets for green hydrogen.
&gt;
&gt;These developments are accelerating a disruption that is already unfolding. RethinkX’s work has shown that SWB along with EVs and A-EVs are the key technologies which are rapidly scaling in the energy and transport sector, and are on track to disrupt all other conventional energy sources purely due to economic factors.

It now makes more sense then ever for nations without fossil fuel reserves to switch to alternatives and those that spearhead the developments could greatly benefit from the emerging markets. Ignoring the change and sticking to the profits of the past is a recipe for economic decline over the next decade. It's a tragedy that we are beholden so much by the interests of the profiteers of the past century, holding back more swift turn arounds and seizing opportunities.

&gt;Would Japan and South Korea react as well to being cut off, and by an ""ally"" to boot?

Here’s a little bit of background about my personal situation. I’ve sensed that there’s something super wrong with the world ever since I was 16. I was lucky enough to have gone to art high-school followed by art uni. When I was little I loved drawing. 
The issue was that what I was interested in making I was always told was not going to be profitable enough to make enough money, and that caused a lot of anxiety in me.

I watched my parents be miserable at work. They both worked physical low paid jobs that were generally looked down. We were immigrants and also looked down on and told to go back home on a daily basis. 

So I had an extreme problem with work ever since I was very young. I could not do most entry level jobs, and by the time I had finished my bachelor in arts and realised the harsh reality of the world of work, it seemed too late. 

Then I also became aware about climate change and just how unsustainable and damaging most human activity on the planet is. I ended up living in Taiwan for 8 years. Then left and got lucky and got a job as a flight attendant for 3 years in Dubai.

I then saw the spectacle of Dubai and how much consumption is created in a totally artificial city in the middle of the desert.. I feel like the last 10 years of my life were sort of a study/observation mode. 

I’ve always been extremely interested in alternative sustainable communities. I’ve always had a interest in spirituality and meditation, and throughout the years I really believed in the power of enlightenment to bring about inner peace. But now about 2 years ago, I decided to pour all of my experience in studying inner work and spirituality into life coaching. And at first I loved the idea of helping people, but the more I learn about climate change.. the more I wonder.. what kind of economy is needed to actually be sustainable.

My concern is that while I can see the benefits of having an online business for myself, and for other people, I also don’t think that the infrastructure that we will need to all work online is feasible in the future as it’s coming towards us. 

I chose to have an online business because I did not want to sell any physical products and quite frankly, I don’t have much else to offer to the world, the only thing I’ve ever spent my time on was art and reading and meditating. But I also feel like there’s no point in reaching inner peace and “living your best life” if the rest of the world is literally dying from our way of life in the west. 

I know it’s no one’s fault as we were all just born into this ignorance.. but I am each day feeling it deeper and deeper in me that the way modern life plays out is just totally insane. And the fact that the vast majority of people is still blinded and wants to achieve success and worships money.. like even my partner: he’s a doctor, and I can understand that dreaming about vacations and owning fancy cars is motivating to him to go through the absolute torture that working in medicine is, I also feel shocked at the level of blindness and lack of care about how this lifestyle is impacting the planet.

So my pain is mainly around the way that we work- I don’t think it’s reasonable for people to work as much as they do- and especially not to do repetitive robotic tasks that so many jobs require. It’s literally killing our souls. Which no one seems to care about.. 

I tend to constantly think about indigenous tribes and the way they lived their lives in harmony with nature.. how they had rituals, and songs and dance and art and they cared about their souls. They would interpret their dreams and be spiritually connected.. I don’t understand why that has lost value over time. 

I find myself very confused.. wanting to do good work that helps people.. but also completely lost as to what is the best way to fit this into a sustainable economic model. Like for example - one thing a lot of spiritual coaches do is that they do retreats.. but then again, this incentivises people to take planes to travel.. and also I think a big issue I have with this kind of work, as much as I know it is necessary for people to rejuvenate and get a chance to catch a breath.. I feel like the solutions we need are systemic and not individual. So part of me feels it’s wrong to profit off of individuals while it’s not their fault that they feel bad in the current system.

What I’d really like to do would be to create a community. 

Anyways, I’m going on and on.. please let me know what you think about this.

I am always looking for ways that I can do something concrete about climate change. One thing that I overlooked for a while is where I was doing my banking. There many banking institutions that continue to contribute in significant ways to the climate disaster. Topping the list is JP Morgan chase. JP Morgan in particular is having an annual shareholder meeting in late spring (April or May) in which shareholders will be able to vote on a proposal to end any expansion of lending for new fossil fuel projects. It doesn’t cover existing funding, but it’s a step in the right direction. I am considering buying one share in order to be able to vote (and selling right after). This could be more immediately effective than protesting outside the bank, because let’s face it they only respond to a couple things- one being money leaving their bank and two being shareholder pressure.

"430547","jv5lpnu",2,"I agree that the act of knowingly causing the destruction of the planet is morally reprehensible, and the act of condemning those at the head of the corporations responsible for facilitating that destruction is a good symbol for environmentalism. However, let's not forget that we as individuals knew about climate change for decades too, and yet most of us continue to use increasing amounts of emitting products. There is a demand for energy that is satiated with fossil fuels and If we punish the heads of a profit generating machine without addressing the demand nothing will change and we have achieved nothing. Let us, in addition to punishing oil execs, also instill a carbon emissions tax to hit oil companies where it hurts most, their wallets. An increase in the price of emitting products will decrease the demand for fossil fuels and increase the demand for lower impact alternatives. The revenue from this tax can be given directly back to the people who are most impacted by both this increase in prices and the impacts of climate change itself.","action","2023-08-07 13:09:29","15jzh27","oIvMvIo",0,2,0,"True","2021-07-11 22:02:55",0,0,114,29,143,229,"[https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/bernie-sanders-climate-change-justice-department-lawsuit-rcna97622](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/bernie-sanders-climate-change-justice-department-lawsuit-rcna97622)

From the article:

When a criminal walks into a store and shoots the clerk behind the counter, we make the moral judgment that this behavior is socially unacceptable, and that the gunman should be punished. 

When a public official misuses and steals taxpayer money, we make the moral judgment that the embezzler should lose his job and, perhaps, be incarcerated.

Yet, when fossil fuel executives make calculated decisions that threaten millions of lives — and the planet itself — we are told that “it’s just business.”

That’s not acceptable.

That is why, earlier this week, I [sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-markey-merkley-and-warren-send-letter-to-attorney-general-urging-doj-to-bring-lawsuits-against-the-fossil-fuel-industry/) urging him to bring lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry in relation to its longstanding and carefully coordinated campaign to mislead consumers and discredit climate science in pursuit of massive profits. The letter was co-signed by Sens. Jeff Merkley, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey.  


EDIT: As a non American I'm not sure of the avenues one would go through to petition the DOJ but everyone that can must get behind this. I really cant see how the world will be able to move forward without holding these people accountable.

A few years ago I posted a video of me doing this skating rant in Quebec, so this video is an updated version.

Lac de Loup is a path through the forest that is flooded and home-made Zambonied at night, and it has been cold enough there to build up a good base of excellent ice. 

Last year, the world famous Rideau Canal skateway in Ottawa never opened for the first time in its half century plus history; it was just not cold enough to have a safe ice thickness.

This year is even warmer, so I don’t expect it to open either. 

Please enjoy the scenery and a vicarious skate through the forest as I chat (rant) somewhat coherently on global warming and wildfires and moose’s and reindeer.

I've been suffering from anxiety related to the decline of nature and climate change since my teens. In my twenties I finally had the courage to switch education and careers into the environment field, but academia turned out to be more about a toxic pyramid scheme than actually doing good for the world. Unfortunately, I recently got into some health issues and realised my time here might be shorter than I expected and there's no time to lose. It really made me take a cold hard look at where my efforts are going and how to better prioritise my life.

Through my friends, we are working on putting together a team and project to plant trees in Bhutan. Could anyone please advise on how we can spread the word and set up avenues to raise funds? Alternatively, can anyone propose a financially sustainable model for us to scale up our conservation projects? I'm not too good with the finance side of things. Our projections show it takes about 2500 USD to plant 1000 native trees using local communities.

“Global heating of the Earth system is unequivocal. However, detecting an acceleration of Earth heating has remained elusive to date, despite suggestive evidence of a potential increase in heating rates. 

In this study, we demonstrate that since 1960, the warming of the world ocean has accelerated at a relatively consistent pace of 0.15 ± 0.05 (W/m2)/decade, while the land, cryosphere, and atmosphere have exhibited an accelerated pace of 0.013 ± 0.003 (W/m2)/decade. This has led to a substantial increase in ocean warming, with a magnitude of 0.91 ± 0.80 W/m2 between the decades 1960–1970 and 2010–2020, which overlies substantial decadal‐scale variability in ocean warming of up to 0.6 W/m2. 

Our findings withstand a wide range of sensitivity analyses and are consistent across different observation‐based datasets. The long‐term acceleration of Earth warming aligns qualitatively with the rise in CO2 concentrations and the decline in aerosol concentration during the same period, but further investigations are necessary to properly attribute these changes.”

“In the past 150 years, Earth’s climate has been warming at a rate that is unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years. 

This human-caused warming has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people, which will continue in the future as global climate continues to warm . Detecting changes in the rate of warming is crucial for informed decision-making in international climate negotiations, with the aim of limiting global warming to specific levels. However, it remains a significant challenge to detect such changes due to the substantial internal variability of the climate system on a decadal scale. 

In this paper, we address this challenge by examining the global heat accumulation rate across the entire climate system, including the ocean, atmosphere, cryosphere, and land. By focusing on this integrated view, rather than solely relying on changes in global mean surface temperature, we can mitigate the impact of variability and gain a more comprehensive understanding.

Global heat accumulation in the climate system, resulting from the current positive Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI) at the top of the atmosphere, is primarily dominated by changes in Global Ocean Heat Content (GOHC). 

GOHC changes account for approximately 90% of the total heat increase in the past fifty years, while land heating, ice melting, and atmospheric warming contribute around 5%, 3%, and 1% respectively. Several studies have indicated an increase in the global heat accumulation rate in recent decades, with values rising from 0.50 [0.32 to 0.69] W/m2 during the period 1971–2006 to 0.79 [0.52 to 1.06] W/m2 (90% confidence interval) for the period 2006–2018. Some studies have even suggested a potential doubling of EEI in the last decade compared to the previous one.”

Just to be clear:

Global Heating is:

1) 90% in oceans
2) 5% in land
3) 3% in ice melting
4) 1% in atmosphere

Yet, we pretty much only focus on our atmospheric warming, caused by that 1% of overall global heating. We do this obviously because it is the heating that we see in our weather and atmosphere. 

Is that wise. Not really. 

And yes. Global warming is accelerating…

Most people who talk about it are either so doom-mongery that it has a damaging effect on my mental health, or so optimistic that they completely misrepresent the seriousness of the problem. One of the very small number of people who has come through my net is Dr Adam Levy, a climate scientist with a doctorate in atmospheric physics. He runs a wonderful YouTube channel, ClimateAdam, intending to discuss climate scenarios in a way that is both realistic accessible and doesn't overwhelm the viewer.

He's far and away the best person I've come across who talks about climate change. He doesn't play down the seriousness of the problem at all, but he's also very good at keeping things in perspective and not being hyperbolic about anything.

So why bamboo?

Bamboo is insanely efficient and is a fast growing grass and researchers say that they're an extreme carbon sink and can produce massive amounts of oxygen (which means they can contribute to making desolate places rain more often which will help plants grow because you need oxygen to combine with hydrogen to make H2O lol).

According to Bamboo Batu:

""According to INBAR (the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization), a well-managed plantation of Moso bamboo can sequester about 32% more CO2 than an equal area of Chinese fir trees. Meanwhile, studies conducted in Colombia indicate that Guadua, a tropical clumping bamboo, can capture 60 tons per acre, about 58% more oxygen than trees. Dr. Barathi is a leading expert in bamboo botany and commercial cultivation based in India. ***According to his research, the tropical species Bambusa balcooa can sequester a total of about 88 tons of carbon dioxide per acre per year. Bamboo stores 24 tons of carbon, Barathi says, and releases 64 tons of oxygen per acre every year. This amount of oxygen is sufficient for 210 to 220 human beings to breathe for the whole year.***""

https://bambubatu.com/bamboo-and-oxygen-a-breath-of-fresh-air/

Nature.com states:

""On an average, one hectare of bamboo stands absorbs about 17 tonnes of carbon per year. However, the biomass production and the carbon-storing potential of the Indian bamboos are largely unexplored.

To find out, the scientists analysed and measured the percentage of carbon content in the culm (stem), sheath, branch and leaf. They also separately estimated the biomass of each of these components.

In BT, the carbon content was found to be the highest in the branch followed by the culm and leave components, whereas in DL the highest percentage of carbon was found in the culm followed by the branch and leave components.

***The average contribution of the different components in the total above-ground biomass of BT was 84 per cent by culm, 8.1 per cent by the branch and 7.1 per cent by leaves. In DL, it was 86 per cent by the culm, 8.7 per cent by the branch and 5 per cent by the leaves.***

***Bamboo plants, the researchers say, also have potential to convert barren lands into a fertile forest.***""

From Lewis Bamb:

""***Bamboo can also tolerate extreme conditions that most plants cannot. It was actually the first plant to re-green after the atomic blast in Hiroshima in 1945.***""

https://lewisbamboo.com/pages/why-bamboo-green-solution#:~:text=Bamboo%20is%20a%20crucial%20element,and%20help%20fight%20global%20warming.

And my personal favorite statement from the Earthbound report:

""***Soil loss remains one of the more overlooked global environmental issues. Almost a third of the world’s land is degraded, presenting a serious obstacle to feeding a growing population in the future. Restoring soil and preserving it for the future is an important 21st century challenge, and bamboo could play a major role.***

Bamboo is a remarkable plant for all kinds of reasons, but it is particularly well suited to land restoration projects. It has long root systems that can reach down deep, drawing up nutrients where other plants would struggle, so they can grow on poor soil or on steep slopes. Those roots bind the soil together and prevent further erosion, with a single bamboo plant able to bind six cubic metres of dirt.

It’s also very resilient. Because it builds up such a huge amount of biomass underground, it can quickly recover from damage, even if it is burned to the ground in a forest fire.

***Once the plant is established, it provides ground cover that helps to prevent run-off, helping to keep moisture in the soil and eventually replenishing groundwater. The leaf-drop begins to return organic matter to the soil, rebuilding fertility. It famously grows very fast, so bamboo can make a difference quickly.***""

https://earthbound.report/2019/08/28/using-bamboo-for-land-restoration/#:~:text=Once%20the%20plant%20is%20established,can%20make%20a%20difference%20quickly

For the Seedbombs aspect this will allow people to spread seeds without having to dig and bury the seeds like one would normally do, this being because the seeds are already covered and merely need to be dropped off.

https://www.epicgardening.com/how-to-make-seed-bombs/

Using bamboo will allow us to just throw the seeds -- well sow -- and just forget about them because bamboo is so resilient and will spread faster than wildfire because of the fact that they are a grass. Once they establish themselves they'll be good. Bamboo is the fastest growing plant on this planet!

https://www.guaduabamboo.com/blog/bamboo-is-the-fastest-growing-plant-on-earth#:~:text=No%20other%20plant%20grows%20faster,and%20Moso%20(Phyllostachys%20edulis).

The fastest species being:

***121 cm by Madake, Phyllostachys reticulata (12 cm in diameter) which is the maximum record of daily growth. It was measured by Koichiro Ueda on the outskirts of Kioto on June 23, 1955.***

**119 cm by Moso, Phyllostachys edulis (diameter of 16 cm), observed on May 24, 1956 by Koichiro Ueda in Nagaoka, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan.**

*91 cm by Bambusa bambos observed at Kew Garden in England in 1855.*

I honestly think this is the best idea to fight climate change passively and give this planet more time... Hopefully.

Edited to add:

I forgot to mention that with the rare they grow at, if strategically placed at say...

I don't know what to believe anymore, I see climate scientist and student making videos and papers about how we can make change and optimism, but then flip-flop to ""there is no hope, lol, see ya in hell"" attitudes the next time.

I need to stop, take a break for a long time from doom scrolling, but I just cant. It's like a drug, I cant let it go. I cant even read a book, play a game with my brothers, or even sleep sometimes without feeling guilty about not doing enough.

I wish I didn't exist. I wish I was better, more powerful so that I could stop this. I'm so worthless and powerless.

So sort of, yes. And at the same time I feel we need a high-touch/people who are in-touch with their likely audiences kind of job plus those who can dedicate their time to figuring out what issues the public already quickly relates with and how those things can relate to cohesive climate action or at least environmental justice and literacy.

If you're thinking an AI tool like chat gpt or copy.ai, it can certainly help spur some better self awareness and reflection especially if it was like a browser plugin and also provided fact checking and references to studies and common arguments/counterarguments ( so far the best website I've seen for this is https://skepticalscience.com/ but a lot of it really gets into the weeds of technical academic jargon as a way to counter what are usually actually emotional appeals and sentiments).

And so having tools to help translate between allied audiences will certainly help though I'd encourage us to also have something that can help people strategically navigate media and amplify messaging too.

But I think what I hear you're proposing is the equivalent of having spell check or grammerly available for climate issues. Meanwhile the other side has lobbyists, PR firms, and full time news agencies devoted to their cause and messaging already captive audiences who are familiar with their own messaging and narratives on anything from the cost of inflation, why people can't get a job(because environmental regulations are frequently scapegoated as the cause for job losses and economic woes), and what the fossil fuel industry has done for their children's local sports club and education. 

Like there are literally entire cities, county governments and even states which are deeply captured by the fossil fuel industry (Pennsylvania, West Virginia in the US are both gripped with industry billboards talking about how wind and solar don't keep the lights on at night/when the wind stops, and there are even education departments and educational publishers for the public schools that forbid the teaching of climate science).

So we need some institutional level organizations and media that really uplift relatable stories and bridge them with sound science in ways that the public can understand and care about sooner.

When *Roe. v. Wade* was overturned, I was in disbelief. After all, we live in America, and while this country had its flaws, there was no way they could just snatch our rights from us. ...I realized that if I were to get pregnant, all my dreams would come crashing down...It would be crushing to be forced to abandon my ambitions for a child I did not want. This is the fate that I feel as though I am doomed to face if our country continues on this trajectory, a fate of oppression and suppression.  


But my anger drives me to action...Vote Climate U.S. PAC is the only website in the country to provide a climate change Voter’s Guide for candidates for[ U.S. House, U.S. Senate](https://voteclimatepac.org/voters-guide/),[ Governors](https://voteclimatepac.org/2022-governors-voters-guide/), and[ Statehouses](https://voteclimatepac.org/state-government/) (partial) all in one user-friendly site. Following the shock of the June overturning, we also decided to share where incumbents and challengers stand on *Roe v. Wade*, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.

I have spent countless late nights researching candidates and writing out descriptions for their positions \[in our voter's guide\], where I have read far too many statements from politicians who have vowed to take away my right to choose with no regard for my life or liberty. That is why this election is so important, and why making an informed vote is even more important — we are deciding the fate of American women.

When I lived in India, I loved being near my family and my culture, I also hated the sexism. I hated how they looked at women in the streets. I hated feeling everything in my life was being controlled by a man. I hated seeing female neighbors and relatives talk about how their husbands wouldn’t let them do anything. I hated the fact that my body was heavily policed. I hated feeling controlled, like there was no escape...

While I am incredibly lucky to live in Maryland where abortion is protected until fetal viability, this will not always be the case. If I were to move for college or my career, I may end up in a state where abortion is banned. This means my right to choose is non-existent, putting my life, career and future in jeopardy.  
 

For those who can vote, I hope you use our Vote Climate U.S. PAC guide to vote climate and vote choice. Vote for climate action and to protect the life and liberty of every American woman. After all, isn’t that what America is all about?

If only we could have stopped doing some of them, then we wouldn’t all of us, each and every one, be about to die horribly within our near lifetimes. Neat how that works out. A slow march into a oblivion and no one ever considered stopping any of it.

The real answer to your question is population controls, but those are deeply unpopular and never, ever implement in a humane way. We straight up CANNOT exponentially increase the number of humans anymore. We are going to do it anyway! 

Luckily nature is one, two hopefully since I’d like more time with the people I care about, years away from rectifying that. Maybe three in rich, first world countries if we get really lucky.

They are going to pray to every god we’ve imagined up and maybe some new ones to go back and “just stop”. It’s going to be poetic justice for our flawed, stupid species.

Ordway, Jr., in the foreword to the group’s 1962 Annual Report. Concerned by potential climatic consequences, the foundation had proposed a conference on the “Carbon Dioxide Content of the Atmosphere” — an informal symposium that would allow a selected panel of experts to clarify their thinking and crystallize their ideas for “future scientific research” on the topic.

By sounding the alarm over CO2-induced climate change, and attempting to propel the issue out of the lab and into the limelight, this long-overlooked conference essentially inaugurated what would become the global climate action movement. Almost a half century before Al Gore’s seminal film and book, “An Inconvenient Truth,” the conference organizers produced what appears to be the first publication devoted entirely to the subject of CO2 and climate change.

That lie is that if we reduce our greenhouse emissions, we can limit climate change -- that each reduction in the rate of emissions lessens the problem.

The confusion results from mixing up the rate of climate change with the final total emissions. By reducing greenhouse emissions in any one context, we reduce the speed of climate change. But if all this does is reduce the speed we get through our fossil fuels, so we end up taking longer to burn exactly the same amount as we would have done anyway, then it makes no difference to the long term outcome.

Imagine if one billion people -- the richest one billion -- all tried really hard to reduce their emissions. So all the super-rich stop using their super-yachts and everybody in the western world buys electric cars, etc... This would reduce demand for fossil fuels, which would lower the price, which would make them more affordable for the other 7 billion humans. The free market would just redirect those fossil fuels to different consumers.  This might slow down the rate of climate change a bit, but it would make zero difference to the final outcome of by the time humans actually stop changing the climate.

The only thing that can actually make a difference to the final outcome is for the producers to stop producing, and leave some economically-extractable fossil fuels in the ground. And nobody is even seriously suggesting such idea. No country that exports fossil fuels is ever going to stop exporting them while there is still both a surplus and a free market, and nobody is suggesting the free market be shut down.

Conclusion: the free market in fossil fuels absolutely guarantees that we will keep burning them until they cease to be economically viable, regardless of the climatic consequences. So we're looking at a final climate change in the order of 5-10 degrees. The exact figure doesn't matter, because the point I am making is this: *nothing anybody does to reduce their emissions is making the slightest bit difference to the final outcome.*

Now...sometimes in response to this I hear people say ""But you mustn't say that, because you'll just encourage the climate change deniers, and nobody will make any effort to reduce their emissions."" My response? *This doesn't make any difference either*. It does not matter what people do. Who cares if they are making it happen a bit faster? What help is it to slow it down a bit?

What would make a difference? The truth might. If what I have written in this post became widely understood by the global public, then it would transform global politics. Not in a way that would lead to limiting climate change, but in a way that force societies to start adapting to the worst case scenario.","Nothing we are currently doing about climate change is going to make the slightest bit of difference.

So we'll see things get worse before they get better. But how much worse they get, as well as if things ever get better, is on how we act. And every bit of worsening climate change avoided is lives saved, billions in economic damages saved, food security heightened, and general quality of life improved. 

As for the political comments, ""breaking out of capitalism"" is unlikely to achieve anything, may even be negative. Emissions are not a result of economic framework, they are a result of human actions which are largely driven by economic reality, and as of right now emissions are built in to many of the things that all powerful countries do a lot of, regardless of economic model. There is no general theoretical reason economic policy could not be mended but others wouldn't need to be mended. Do note that the soviet union was the second largest greenhouse emitter, and china now is by leaps and bounds the largest emitter. There are many resource dictatorships/single party states/military states/petrostates have large per capita emissions that are also unsustainable. You could twist yourself in knots blaming those cases on capitalism/colonialism, and you would even have *some* points (not a comprehensive argument), but at that point you're arguing about political theory, and typically when that happens ecological policy takes a backseat to ideology. Not blaming you in particular for that, just get annoyed by people clinging to bad solutions, when like you've said there are incremental changes to be made that make a world of difference over time. 

Emissions, along with ecosystem degradation, are negatives to be avoided, and that'll only happen with 

3) no will to perpetuate (superior economic alternatives help)

2) no ability to perpetuate (this is a desperate or at best negligent situation that no group willingly enters) 

1) solid governmental policy with strong enforcement

Realistically, you need a combination of 3) and 1) to get people to stop destroying the environments that we rely on to exist. 2) only happens when there is no more environment to exploit or when we all become too poor. However, I think we need to incorporate more restorative changes as well. Carrots and sticks, positives and preventing negatives

It's that all the things which would've been produced using those fossil fuels no longer exist, making global consumers worse off by that amount and shrinking what they can purchase with their income. No clever tricks with price caps or windfall taxes or rejecting the free market entirely can fix this; there just isn't as much stuff there for them to buy and there's no capacity to produce it either. We've already seen this on a small scale after Russia cut off natural gas exports. If anything it increases profits, since it drives up prices for fossil fuels whilst saving companies from spending money on expanding production.
  

  
In concrete terms, this means even more people forced to choose between heating and eating. It means the workers who are already striking due to their pay shrinking in real terms find it's now worth even less. It's not something a political party can deliver and survive, not because a few super-rich people will dislike it - actually, they'd likely not be affected that much, mostly because their consumption is so tiny compared to both the world as a whole and their financial resources that it's easy to support - but because the general public would revolt.","science","2023-12-10 00:49:57","18eopa0","JustInChina50",0,2,0,"True","2023-09-17 02:38:26",0,0,964,5302,6266,13,"","Cop28: China ‘would like to see agreement to substitute renewables for fossil fuels’ | But country’s climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, would not say whether it would support phase-out wording in climate deal",0.94,13,0,"2023-12-09 22:23:41"

US companies are so focused on profits-now, they lack the wisdom for long-term investing. This is why running any business to please greed-conquered insatiable shareholders is problematic; why any national utility needs to be 100% fed-government owned.

But just replacing lines does not address the greater issues with the grid itself. It uses more power than any (other) 1 source on the continent; it poses fire risks that have already cost human life.

*Rather than investing any more into the US grid, we could take that same money and put (the current overstock of) solar panels on nearly very building on the continent; then add to that portable wind mills; use geothermal where it is cost–viable; and most importantly, invent ways to use far less with hyper–efficiency paradigms. But inhumans cannot think in human terms; they are horrifyingly trapped in serving money. Therefore, it is all profits and costs, today.* ([Source](https://monkofyhvh.neocities.org/grid))

""While the wildfires raging in the Amazon rainforest may constitute an “international crisis,” they are hardly an accident.
The vast majority of the fires have been set by loggers and ranchers to clear land for cattle. The practice is on the rise, encouraged by Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s populist pro-business president, who is backed by the country’s so-called “beef caucus.”
While this may be business as usual for Brazil’s beef farmers, the rest of the world is looking on in horror.


So, for those wondering how they could help save the rainforest, known as “the planet’s lungs” for producing about 20% of the world’s oxygen, the answer may be simple. Eat less meat.""- CNN

It's the only solution to emissions that doesn't involve prohibition of activities and use cases, like mandatory car pooling.


What corporations are intentionally hiding is that the ""tax"", if done correctly, is revenue neutral. All the money coming in from the price of putting poison in the air, is invested in programs and alternatives to make them more desirable and affordable. 


Before bottle deposits were a thing, people threw their bottles on the ground. Broken glass was everywhere. By putting a deposit on that bottle, which is the ""waste"" after using its contents, there's an incentive to return it rather than throw it on the ground. This cleans up the mess of the bottles without specific laws and even creates ways for kids and the homeless to make money cleaning up after people who don't care. 


*it creates a new economy* 


The carbon economy is coming and farming is by far one of the hardest things to figure out. If carbon were properly taxed (which is WAY higher than anyone is comfortable saying out loud), a very good place to put that money would be in electric tractors and the development of more sustainable but commercial scale agricultural methods. 


It's a little more painful than the regular bottle deposit because you have to pay until the carbon economy becomes visible and accessible to the point where a whole pile of new jobs open up. But without it, there will never be an incentive to clean up after ourselves and we'll continue to profit from never paying for the cleanup and only the extraction and delivery of fossil fuels.

What Is Global Climate Change?

Global climate change is the ongoing, long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth’s climate system. This rise in temperatures is caused by the increase in greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, resulting in a rise in global temperatures.

What Causes Global Climate Change?

Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy is the primary cause of global climate change. When these fuels are burned, they release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is the main culprit in climate change because it is the most prevalent greenhouse gas.

Deforestation is another major contributor to global climate change. Trees absorb carbon dioxide as part of the photosynthesis process, and when large areas of forest are cleared for agriculture or other purposes, this reduces the number of carbon dioxide-absorbing trees available. This, in turn, increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

What Are the Effects of Climate Change?

The effects of climate change are far-reaching and can be seen in changes to weather patterns, sea levels, and ecosystems. Warmer temperatures can lead to droughts and extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes. In addition, rising sea levels caused by melting ice caps and glaciers can lead to flooding and coastal erosion.

Changes to ecosystems, such as the bleaching of coral reefs or the displacement of wildlife, can also be attributed to climate change. These changes threaten entire species and disrupt food systems, leading to widespread food insecurity.

What Can We Do to Address Climate Change?

The most effective way to address climate change is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and move towards renewable sources of energy like wind and solar. This will reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere.

In addition, we can reduce deforestation by conserving existing forests and planting new trees. This will help to absorb more carbon dioxide and reduce the global temperature.

Finally, we can make lifestyle changes that will reduce our carbon footprint. Simple actions like buying energy-efficient appliances, cultivating a garden, and turning off lights when not in use can all help to reduce our carbon emissions.

The effects of climate change are far-reaching and will continue to worsen if we don’t take action. We must all take steps to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and prioritize conservation and renewable energy sources. Taking steps today can help to preserve our planet for future generations.","What Is Global Climate Change?",0.29,0,0,"2023-12-19 22:11:13"

We need a lot of fossil fuels to support the current population. The only way to maintain standards of living (which means maintaining the fossil fuel energy required for it) without continuing to worsen the climate is to reduce population. This will encourage many people to conclude “we should just get rid of ___.”

The global 1% includes a large portion of the American middle class. While you might feel justified “getting rid of” billionaires and their super yachts, someone from a lower income country will likewise feel justified getting rid of many of the civilians in *your* country, and they’ll enthusiastically support their government in doing so. Or, as is more likely the case, in getting rid of whatever local groups they find objectionable. 

Massive genocides require government organization and industrialization, and once set into motion, it’s hard to slow them down. The effects of “getting rid of” whoever we deem to be using too much energy would also affect the stability of every nation that pursues such methods as the non-targeted populations aim to prove themselves more worthy than the rest. 

Same goes for war. We could simply force people into using less energy, but that will lead to armed conflict in any situation where the people being forced into energy reduction have arms. 

The truth is that no government or group of people is powerful enough to carry out any plan without significant cooperation. There is no puppeteer whose strings we can sever to make everything right again. Nobody is in control of this crisis. It’s already chaotic.

I fail to understand how someone who does not need a car (in cities with good public transit in europe) can declare with passion that they will never let go of their fossil fuel car and hate on electric cars, how people still claim they can't live without having meat everyday etc.   
And worst of all, I just don't know how to deal with this in a productive way. Is there something I can do to make a more green lifestyle look more desirable or something? How can we make people in our personal surrounding understand that they need to change something, without increasing the overall hate and anger? How can we counter the framing that conservative parties use that everything green will cause misery, scarcity and distress?

In the end, the book is a work of fiction, so I wouldn't expect wide and varied sources of authorship. Would have been nice to have indigenous voices involved. That said, I believe the people discussed were ancient, pre agricultural cultures, not contemporary indigenous.

Population ""hasn't been for 50 years""... try zooming out. Your time scale is a bit narrow to see the exponential growth curve. Again, it was a cool day today, but the earth is still warming ever quicker.

So the problem on our planet is that there isn't enough money for everyone? Or that the distribution is not equitable? I think you're failing to take the next logical step because some people you find abhorrent (and I agree that they are) are already standing there. It's a scary and dangerous line of thinking, yes: capitalism requires ever greater growth in profits each year to be successful long term (for investors), and the only way to ensure that is to sell more next year, and the only way to ensure that is to gain more customers each year...and to ensure that, you need to expand into all possible markets...and make sure those markets continue to grow...by adding more people. Adding more people. It is the inevitable zenith of the entire system. 

Fact: that is unsustainable. Consumption, production, pollution, etc will continue to expand because they MUST, despite temporary stagnation, long term, expansion is inevitable until it CAN'T happen any further, until we're to far in debt to nature that it is no longer possible that we expand, and natural limiting factors shorten our lifespans, quality of life, etc. 

The abhorrent among us will devise strategies to abate this, violence and control. I don't support this at all. 

Generally, I don't have a solution here. The only thing I can think of is governmental incentives for having smaller families (a childLESS tax credit, for example), but why would they do this when they are run by...the capitalists? Quinn suggests a slow reduction in food production, but again, theres no real way to land that plane. 

So, generally, long term, I think we're simply fcked. There is no policy to curb the population issue. It's hard wired in our brains. Intelligent life, it turns out, is not good for an ecosystem. Redistribution of capital doesn't seem like it would change a thing. We'll continue on, a little cleaner, a little more efficiently, but overall, totally destroying the planet until we can't. Maybe whatever evolves from the very last of the human species will be just a degree dumber than us and unable to start the engine back up.","action","2023-10-15 23:35:46","16x3gmq","ThomasPaine_1776",0,1,0,"True","2021-03-17 12:57:56",0,24,30,176,230,2,"Please use this thread to post your current Climate Action oriented discussions and any other concerns or comments about climate change action in general.

If you want to know the direction the industry will take, don't look at market share and apply a growth rate.  Look at what factories and production capacity are being built today.  That determines what will be sold in the coming years.

No one is building new ICE factories that I'm aware of, and pretty much all R&amp;D on ICE drivetrains has stopped as far as I'm aware.  At most, the ICE world will see mild refreshes of existing models.  I don't see many new models being launched at all.

For the most part, EV factories are simply re-tooled ICE factories.  There are some exceptions, but this is the main story.  For example, GM has said their factory footprint is sufficient for the EV world.  They are not building new factories, but re-tooling old ones.  So every EV line they launch means an ICE line being deprecated.

I'm older and have money. Because of climate change, I've given up flying for years, so I never travel to Europe anymore (which I used to love to do yearly).

I've also taken Amtrak instead of flying for most of my trips (barring situations where the train leaves in the wee hours on a freezing night or Amtrak cancels).

Because I'm older, female (and acknowledging privilege here), I like to get a roomette if I'm going to be sleeping on the train because I can't sleep in coach. (For people who don't know, the rides are very JOLTING. Amtrak runs on *freight* tracks. That and the horn constantly sounding, people getting on and off at every stop, loud talkers, people watching shows without headphones, etc. make 48 hours a long time to go without sleep.)

A roomette (small fold down bed, private, more secure, no people getting on and off, etc.) costs a shit ton more than flying. Example: A trip that's 8 hours round trip flying is 48 hours *plus delays* via Amtrak. Coach plane tickets (totally doable, cause it's not 48 hours) cost $275. Amtrak roomette costs $2,100.

With my privilege, I invest in climate-friendly stocks when there's enough extra to invest. (A lot of them don't do so well, but I figure they need support from investors). 

Bottom line: In terms of climate change, is it better to take the flight and invest the money? Or is flying so bad I should stick with the train?

I'm aware of contrails leading to upper atmosphere clouds that blanket heat against the earth and exacerbate warming. It's a bigger problem than the GHG emissions. Just don't know which is the better way to go here with the money.

"299363","kcfpuos",1,"I don’t think there is any argument from me about day/night contrails and their resultant cooling/warming. There’s plenty of literature on this topic.

Glancing through some literature, contrails that expand over a large fraction of sky are very rare. Most literature mentions contrails that do develop from plane exhaust persists for less than 10 minutes. For contrails that do expand to cover a large fraction of sky, the radiative forcing is dependent on the particle habits (particle structure - spherical, etc.) and optical cloud depth. Not all environments promote the same particle structure. There’s also some uncertainty in these values as mentioned in the literature.

One study (Meerkotter et al., 1999) does mention for an assumed global mean contrail cover of 0.1%, the annual contrail radiative forcing is similar to the radiative forcing of aviation emitted CO2 (~0.02 W/m^2), which is about 2% of the total anthropogenic forcing measured against the pre-industrial atmosphere reported by the IPCC in the 1999 Summary for Policymakers report.

I still think the reduction of longer-lived impacts onto the global climate system such as CO2 versus short-lived contrail impacts is more important. A reduction in plane traffic would also reduce the warming by nighttime contrails. That said, if aircraft fuel were made greener to reduce their CO2 emissions, then there’s a possibility their  nighttime contrails will be the “dirtiest” of their emissions based on the literature I’ve looked at.

**Senator Raphael Warnock:**

**No Comparison on Climate or Choice**

**in Today’s Runoff Election**

Today is the runoff election in Georgia between Senator Raphael Warnock (D) and his opponent, for a one-vote margin in the U.S. Senate between the Democrats, who passed historic climate legislation in the *Inflation Reduction Act*, and the other party, which mostly denies climate change. Senator Warnock’s Vote Climate U.S. PAC Climate Calculation is 81.25 as compared to his opponent’s score of 7.5 out of 100. His support for *Roe v. Wade*, the U.S. Supreme court decision that legalized abortion sets Warnock apart from his opponent, who not only opposes *Roe*, but reportedly does so hypocritically while having paid for several abortions himself.

“Based on the research for our [2022 Vote Climate U.S. PAC U.S. House and U.S. Senate, national climate change voter’s guide](https://voteclimatepac.org/voters-guide/), Senator Raphael Warnock understands the importance of climate action as a top priority position. On his campaign website, Senator Warnock states ‘Our state urgently needs leaders who will accept the science, invest in infrastructure, and combat the climate crisis that is already at our door.’ His opponent, candidate Herschel Walker disagrees with the scientific consensus that climate change is real and human-made, from burning fossil fuels. In a *Washington Post* article, candidate Walker criticizes the *Inflation Reduction Act*, legislation that includes a significant amount of funding and plans to combat climate change, by calling the legislation ‘wasteful spending. He asked, ‘Don't we have enough trees?’” according to Karyn Strickler, President of Vote Climate U.S. PAC.

President Biden’s *Build Back Better* agenda was an opportunity to take action to tackle the climate crisis in a way that addresses racial and economic inequality and creates millions of good jobs. The *Build Back Better* investments set the U.S. on a path to cutting carbon pollution by at least half by 2030 and 100% carbon-free energy powering our electricity grid, new cars, buses, and buildings by 2035, while delivering at least 40% of benefits to communities of color and low-income communities that have borne the brunt of fossil fuel pollution.

“Vote Climate U.S. PAC believes we must eliminate all human-made, greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, to slow climate change and related weather extremes. Only the complete elimination of these greenhouse gas *emissions* will lead to a slow reduction in the *atmosphere* over the next century. The cuts in carbon pollution in the *Build Back Better* put us on the path to realizing these goals, unlike any legislation before it. Senator Warnock voted in favor of this legislation,” said Strickler

According to the League of Conservation’s scorecard, “Senator Schumer proposed Senate Amendment 5194 to H.R. 5376, introducing the *Inflation Reduction Act* of 2022, to invest $369 billion in climate, jobs, and justice, marking the single largest investment in climate action in American history. The bill incentivizes clean energy, domestic manufacturing, clean vehicles, innovative technologies, and energy efficiency that will save families hundreds of dollars annually, are tied to strong labor provisions, and include added incentives for investments made in low-income and fossil-fuel impacted communities.”

With the 5 votes, including the 2 above, Senator Warnock voted 100% pro-climate on the votes scored by Vote Climate U.S. PAC, while serving in the U.S. Senate. Since his opponent is not a member of the U.S. Senate, he has not taken any climate votes, but it seems clear, given his position, that his votes would not likely be in favor of climate action.

Karyn Strickler said, “In terms of leadership, Senator Warnock scored a 75 out of 100, on our Vote Climate U.S. PAC, national climate change voter’s guide, so he can still make leadership on climate change a top priority to improve his leadership score, but his opponent who does not even believe climate change is real, so once again there is no comparison between the two candidates. According to a 2021 Grist article, ‘...Warnock believes that ‘the Earth is the Lord’s’ according to his website, which lays out his support for a clean energy transition, environmental justice, and stewardship of the natural world. He is a proponent of rejoining the Paris Agreement, reversing Trump’s rollbacks, investing in climate resiliency projects to prepare the Georgia coastline for rising sea levels...’ Even if you don’t come to the issue of climate change from a religious point of view, this still leads Warnock to a respectable place.’”

Alas, Senator Raphael Warnock has no known or an inconsistent position on a U.S. fee on carbon pollution, a fee imposed on fossil fuels intended to dramatically reduce or eliminate the emission of carbon dioxide from those sources. A carbon fee would also aid in the switch from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy and slow climate change. Warnock needs to support a fee on carbon pollution -- publicly and unequivocally. As a demonstration of this reality, his opponent also has no known or an inconsistent position on a U.S. fee on carbon. 

“The bottom line in today’s runoff election is that while there is room for improvement for the incumbent Senator Raphael Warnock, especially on climate leadership and a fee on carbon pollution, there is absolutely no comparison between him and his opponent, if you care about climate. Senator Warnock supports reproductive choice, his opponent does not, except, it seems, when his own girlfriends get pregnant. For all these reasons, Senator Raphael Warnock is a Vote Climate U.S. PAC Priority Candidate. If you’ve not already voted, show up today and if you are in the voting line before the deadline, usually 8:00PM, don’t leave until you have cast your vote,” said Karyn Strickler, President of Vote Climate U.S. PAC.","Senator Raphael Warnock: No Comparison on Climate or Choice in Today’s (December 6) Runoff Election",0.98,94,0,"2022-12-05 22:57:29"

Another [high tide,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/04/10/sea-level-rise-southern-us/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) and retired Navy Capt. Terry Bragg wades from his office into a flooded parking lot in the rain boots he always keeps close at hand.

Around him, the water on this otherwise ordinary Tuesday creeps over concrete sea walls and fills drainage ditches. It covers swaths of grass and swallows most of a nearby fire hydrant. It devours stretches of sidewalk and inches past dead and dying oak trees hung with Spanish moss, their leafless limbs an unmistakable sign of their roots’ constant exposure to saltwater.

In barely half an hour, it is a foot deep or more in places. The water has consumed hundreds of parking spots and created an obstacle course for anyone trying to navigate to the visitor’s center of the historic Battleship North Carolina, which for more than six decades has been anchored here, across the Cape Fear River from downtown Wilmington.

“This is climate change,” Bragg, the site’s executive director since 2009, says as he stands ankle deep in floodwaters that inch higher by the minute.

The hulking battleship behind him is many things: a floating museum and one of North Carolina’s most visited tourist sites; the most decorated U.S. battleship of World War II, with 15 battle stars; and an enduring memorial to the more than 11,000 North Carolinians who served and died in that war.

But its site on low-lying Eagles Island also faces serious peril from rising seas and constant inundation.

The museum’s leaders have documented a more than 7,000 percent increase in tidal flooding at the site since it opened to the public in 1961. The changes in the past decade or so alone have been dramatic. In 2011, the battleship site recorded about 20 flood events. By 2020, the property was flooding roughly half of the year. The trend that shows no signs of slowing.

In 2022, even though the battleship had nearly a quarter-million visitors and its most successful financial year ever, the site experienced nearly 200 days of flooding. Officials had to close it at times when the lone access road vanished underwater or visitors couldn’t safely navigate the salty lake that forms in front of the main entrance to the 35,000-ton warship.

“If I can’t sell tickets and provide parking, I can’t keep the battleship open,” Bragg said of the site, which is overseen by a state commission but receives no regular government appropriations for its operations.

Without some sort of intervention, there’s little doubt that the problem will become only more dire. The battleship sits 28 miles upstream from the Cape Fear River’s confluence with the Atlantic Ocean and about a half a mile from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tidal gauge that has been collecting water level data continuously since 1935.

In that time, its data shows, sea levels at that spot have risen roughly 9 inches, although the rate of rise has accelerated over the past decade. Scientists project that they could rise another foot by the middle of the century.

“You can see the change,” said Jenny Davis, a North Carolina-based research ecologist at the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, which is part of NOAA. “The number of flood events is only going to increase over time.”

That is true for sites all [on the East Coast,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2022/east-coast-sea-level-rise/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18) which face growing[ threats from sea-level rise](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/obx-rodanthe-erosion-rising-sea-levels/?itid=lk_inline_manual_18) and repeat flooding. But that’s where the Battleship North Carolina’s story diverges from that of some other spots confronting similar risks.

Feeling an urgency to act — and knowing that only worse problems could be on the way — the site’s leaders decided several years ago that they did not want to try to hold back the rising waters.

Instead, they would look for a way to live with the changing landscape around them, even if that meant doing what many places are not willing to do: surrender land back to nature.

It’s not a choice between actions, it’s a commitment to action on multiple fronts. While you eat less meat and use less energy and purchase fewer products, you can also do political action (parliamentary/electoral style: campaigning or canvassing), public protests, and disruptive direct actions. The importance and efficacy of the latter should never be discounted or downplayed, nor should it be seen as the only solution at the expense of individual consumer choices and collective political action.

First post here. I just wanted to share something that I've gotten really into in the last few years, which is the Buy It For Life (BIFL) movement. If I were to guess, many of you reading this are already members, but there's a pretty thriving subreddit r/BuyItForLife if you'd like to join a community devoted to this concept. The Venn-diagram between climate activists and BIFLs is probably not a complete circle, but it's close.  


Anyway, one of the things that got me into this was a snarky comment from the CEO of Gibson (at the time) James Curleigh. I believe this in 2018 or 2019, pre pandemic for sure. He was being interviewed about a new line of sustainable guitars Gibson was releasing (using sustainable woods and natural finishes). He actually defended the rest of the Gibson line of guitars too by saying that their first sustainable priority was to ""make guitars that people won't want to throw away for a hundred years.""   


When I first heard him say that, I laughed it off. But it started nagging at me that I think he was actually right. I started looking around at all the things I've purchased that definitely had expiration dates for one reason or another. Then I thought back to all the bags of trash I've filled during spring cleanings. All the garbage clothes, furniture, electronics, and kitchenware that just came and went because I just shopped for the cheapest thing possible.   


Now, I shop very deliberatively. I'll make up my mind to buy something long before I pull the trigger on it. Partly to save up for it, and partly to wait for a good deal to come around. I no longer ""shop the deals,"" instead, I wait to see if the deals apply to the things I know I need/want. And I buy things I know I'll be able to get at least 10 years out of, but ideally much longer if I take care of them. I cook with cast iron and carbon steel now mostly instead of nonstick. I've purchased boots that can be repaired when the souls are worn down. I even stopped using the dryer for most clothes and have purchased a drying rack to extend the life of them as much as possible. This year though, my big purchase was a Fjallraven winter jacket that uses their G1000 wax. It was expensive, but in all likelihood this jacket will outlive me. So in the long run, I would've spent the same on jackets that would fall apart after a few years. But it doesn't have to be expensive. A lot of BIFL stuff is dirt cheap, because a lot of it has been around for a LONG time, so long that you might be able to find a lot of it at antique shops or thrift stores.  


I know that this a privilege not afforded to many people who either need things immediately, or cannot afford to buy the quality they'd like. I also know that changing our own consumer spending habits really is just a drop in the bucket for climate impacts. I know that the carbon footprint is a scam made up by fossil fuel think tanks. But it's something, and I think if you have the means and you're not already doing so, I would highly encourage you to consider spending some time exploring the idea. Because its something you can control, and it feels pretty damn good too.","Buy It For Life (BIFL) movement",0.86,10,0,"2023-12-27 02:46:29"

You may not have to switch parties, it depends on your specific state election laws. 

I know there is not a stand-out candidate on climate in the Republican field but how the debate is framed is still important. The less worse candidates on climate generally line up with those who are pro-democracy which is helpful. I know for many this may be hard to vote for any Republican but with no Democratic presidential primary, this is one of the easiest ways to make our voice heard before November. Political parties do shift and we can be part of that.

None of these candidates have the answers I’d prefer, but they are much better than some other candidates who call climate change a hoax (Trump, Ramaswamy)  or have their state reject climate money (DeSantis).

* Asa Hutchinson - I can’t find a clip but I understand he was raising his hand to say it was real.

We can shift the Republican debate from ""Is climate change real?"" to ""How will you fight climate change?""

1. Figure out your states rules/times, [start here](https://ballotpedia.org/Primary_election_systems_by_state) (Note some states like California treat the presidential race differently than other races).

Vote Climate U.S. PAC's priority U.S. Senate races are all very close and could go either way on Election Day, Tuesday, November 8th. They are all critical for climate-action, reproductive choice and American democracy itself. According to Cook Political Report, all of our priority candidates including: John Fetterman (D), Pennsylvania; U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D), Nevada; U.S. Senator Raphael Warnock (D), Georgia; U.S.   
Senator Mark Kelly (D), Arizona and Mandela Barnes (D), Wisconsin, are in toss-up races.  


There is no comparison between our priority candidates and their opponents on climate change. Vote Climate U.S. PAC is the only website in the country to provide a climate change Voter's Guide for candidates for U.S. House, U.S. Senate, Governors and Statehouses (partial). (Always click the green + button for detailed research.) Like most Voter's Guides, we score incumbents on pivotal climate votes in Congress. We also assess a candidate's position: what do candidates say about the issue; leadership: what do they do; and putting a fee on carbon polluters. The average of those scores creates their Climate Calculation.  


In 2022 for the first time, we indicate if a candidate supports Roe v. Wade. We see a strong connection between climate and choice, so while it is not part of our Climate Calculations, we have included support or opposition to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, in our national climate change voter's guide.There is no comparison between our priority candidates and their opponents on climate change. Four of five of the opponents have a Climate Calculation of 7.5 or less and the other one scores 28.75, all failing grades on any scale. Every opponent opposes Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion and many of them are 2020 election deniers. These are the races that we believe will most advance climate action and reproductive choice.

"369820","k7jnhx6",3,"**From Matthew Cappucci:**

Severe thunderstorms produce damaging winds, large hail and tornadoes, but climate scientists have debated how they’re affected by rising temperatures. Now a new study published in Nature Climate Change estimates the central United States has seen a dramatic increase in the coverage of severe thunderstorm winds over the past four decades and that human-caused climate change is contributing.

The findings suggest a fivefold increase in the area affected by straight-line winds since the early 1980s. Straight-line winds are different from tornadoes, since they feature downward-moving air that fans out in a straight line, but can cause just as much damage.

It’s estimated that thunderstorm winds cause an average of 26 deaths and $2.5 billion in damages each year in the United States. Among the most serious windstorms are derechos — large, arcing thunderstorm complexes that deliver a wall of straight line winds as strong as a hurricane. On rare occasions, such winds can exceed 130 mph.

That’s what happened on Aug. 10, 2020, when a violent derecho formed in eastern Nebraska, blasted Iowa and continued into Chicago. Satellite data suggested that 10 million acres of corn, representing 43 percent of Iowa’s crop, was damaged. A staggering $7.5 billion in damage resulted, making it the most costly severe thunderstorm event in U.S. history.

Experts fear that similar episodes may become increasingly common in a warmer climate but scientists say understanding the climate change influence on thunderstorm winds has proven challenging.

I have been getting frustrated by how useless carbon credits are, but cannot shake the feeling that the free-market system still has a lot of potential to drive society-wide positive climate action. So please consider and critique the following idea I have for a personal carbon credit system. If there is any merit to it, your criticisms will be useful to refine it:

On a global level, climate change is being driven primarily by the extraction of fossilized carbon, and injecting it into the environment. This not only includes the fossil fuel industry, but also petrochemicals, fertilizer manufacturing, etc. Thus, I propose a carbon credit with a twist. **Instead of making carbon credits as a permit for each end user to emit CO2, we make carbon credits as a permit to extract crude oil, coal, and natural gas. Extractors would use these carbon credits to buy a permit from the regulator to extract these resources, and the regulator destroys the credit upon receiving them.**

**How many carbon credits per tonne of coal/oil/gas?**

We already know the chemistry and can calculate exactly how much CO2 is released by fully oxidizing that resource, and that is exactly how many carbon credits the extractor would need. This is the “sink” for these credits.

**What is the “source” of these credits?**

We distribute the carbon credits equally to every person in the jurisdiction where this system is being implemented. We recognize that until we finish the transition, we still require these commodities to live in today’s world, but we also recognize that every person has an equal right to life in this society. Only human persons receive their share, companies/organizations/corporations receive nothing.

**How do these credits make their way from the “source” (individual people) to the “sink” (carbon extractors)?**

The credits act as a parallel currency to the existing national fiat currency system. Participants in the economy would naturally only require these carbon credits if their activities are still coupled to fossil fuels/petrochemicals. For example:

* You buy a bus ticket with money + carbon credits.
* The bus operator buys diesel from the fuel distributor with money + carbon credits.
* The fuel distributor buys diesel from the refiner with money + carbon credits.
* The refiner buys crude oil from the oil driller with money + carbon credits.
* The oil diller buys the permits to continue their operation from the government/regulator with carbon credits.
* The government/regulator destroys the credits.

**How many credits does the regulator create?**

The plan for the quota must meet our climate goals of decoupling from fossil fuels fast enough to prevent as much human suffering as possible, while recognizing that if we constrain our fossil fuel use too early and suddenly, the economic shock can also reduce our ability to transition rapidly and cause immediate harm to people. This must be analyzed by experts on climate science as well as other fields, and updated as our understanding of the situation evolves. It must also be made public knowledge to give people and organizations the information necessary to plan their transition. For example, at the start we can maintain the current trend of fossil fuel extraction to try to minimize economic shock, then gradually reduce the quota over time, accelerating as time progresses until we reach our climate targets at the required deadline.

**What happens if you want/need to consume more than your allowance can afford?**

You can buy them from someone else through an exchange setup by the regulator to facilitate instant and free trading of credits. Key point, you cannot buy them directly from the regulator, the regulator only creates new credits based on the quota and distributes them equally. Thus, to pollute more than your fair share, you must always buy the privilege from someone else who has polluted less than their fair share (either through conscious action, or being unable to afford to consume at that level).

**Some advantages of this system:**

* We have a simple policy tool to set a clear roadmap to achieving the decoupling from fossil fuels, which we can adjust depending on the development of climate science and the progress of the transition.
* We create a tangible and measurable incentive for all levels of society to decouple from fossil carbon. For businesses, decoupling from fossil carbon now can provide a measurable cost advantage for ecological action. For individuals, reducing carbon intensive consumption can bring additional wealth through credits sold.
* We reduce the cost of administering the carbon credit system.  
Existing systems that apply to emissions must account for the intricacies of every form of emissions in our complex economy. For example, the way to calculate emissions for a drinks bottling plant that consumes plastics will be very different from a farm that consumes chemical fertilizers, or an individual driving a petrol powered automobile.  
This system that applies to fossil fuel producers only needs to account for the carbon mass fraction of the raw fossil carbon (coal/oil/gas), and needs to audit a much smaller number of entities (coal miners, oil/gas drillers).
* We create a redistributive mechanism for wealth. Anyone wishing to pollute more than their fair share must do so in exchange for a part of their economic power. Today, we do not price the externalities of emissions, and thus encroach on each other’s right to a safe climate for free. While this is primarily aimed at rewarding people who make environmentally friendly decisions and delivering some justice to people who never had the wealth capacity to cause the climate crisis, it can also be sold to the rich and powerful as a mitigating factor to their outsize emissions.
* We delegate decisions to the local level by letting every economic player determine what is their own best course of action to decouple from fossil carbon, based on their knowledge of their specific context and capabilities.
* Less intrusive on privacy. The government does not need to track and categorize what individuals do or buy to assess their carbon cost. The carbon cost of products is determined by the free market. If a business overprices their products in carbon credits, that cost is directly convertible into a monetary cost that can be used to compare similar offers from competitors.
* Democratic advantage. In a system with unbalanced emissions, it is a mathematical certainty that the people who pollute more will be a minority. Thus the majority will benefit from the redistributive properties of the system, which should be advantageous to politicians to back it in a democratic system.

**Other notes:**

* This system only aims to facilitate the transition away from fossil carbon, and cannot act on its own. It must be used in parallel with other actions to repair the damage we have already done.","Can we create a better carbon credit?",0.9,8,0,"2024-03-04 00:25:08"

"436483","izawupz",13,"Bad comment. Read the book or the article and you'll learn that Malm's purpose is to examine the history of climate activism and broaden its paradigm, not endorse widespread and indiscriminate violence.

He also emphasizes the huge ethical difference between violence against people and property destruction. 

The book examines strategies that have been utilized so far by the climate movement and other movements for justice such as the Civil Rights Movement, anti-Apartheid Movement, etc. Malm intends to explore strategies so activists can apply what's already been successful to the current fight against the climate crisis. Since the historically peaceful climate movement has so far failed to achieve its goals, it'll likely need to widen its range of acceptable strategies to win the climate battle, i.e. destruction of fossil fuel capital + building of alternative support structures, etc.

The book (and climate activists) would never advise ""blow[ing] up a cafe in Miami"" because (a) it's not ethical and (b) it's not strategic. It's unethical because we agree it's not right to take another being's life and it's not strategic because it doesn't help achieve the goals of curbing carbon emissions or attracting more people to the cause.

Your reference to turning the West into Syria seems unnecessary and xenophobic imo. I understand what emotions you're trying to stir by comparing terrorists/war in Syria with pretend eco-terrorists in the West. I'd just like to point out that so-called Western countries are already  engaging in plenty of war and suffering around the world, and that Syria emitted 0.07% of 2021's carbon emissions.

Advocacy is an integral part of activism. Yet some of us sometimes struggle to get our thoughts across to the people we want to communicate to. Slam poetry is an unique avenue of advocacy that combines performance with poetry, an avenue that we have not yet explored.

The people affected are diverse, and often forgotten as they are caught in the crossfire between economic progress and climate change. Embark on a voyage of advocating and spreading the message through slam poetry for those who have to pack up their entire lives and move elsewhere because of climatic reasons.

There’s no signing up required, so join spontaneously and add value to the session! Block it in your calendars 💫🗓️

The details for the meeting are as follows:

&gt;UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain is tired of working for free.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a series of posts last week on the social media site formerly known as Twitter, Swain — who has been quoted in The Times and other media outlets hundreds of times over the last decade — lamented how hard it is to make a living sharing information about the climate crisis with the public. He said it’s nearly impossible for climate scientists to get paid for communications work — even though that work is badly needed in an era of rampant carbon pollution.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The status quo is not sustainable,” Swain wrote.  
&gt;  
&gt;His posts went viral. They were shared by dozens of scientists and journalists who lamented the lack of public and private funding dedicated to improving public understanding of ever-deadlier heat waves, fires, droughts, storms and more.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It’s particularly ironic as scientists are often accused of ‘being in it for the money’ when in fact like teachers who use their salaries to buy supplies for their students, we donate our own salaries and time to these efforts because they matter so much,” wrote Katharine Hayhoe, a professor at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Journalists rely hugely on a network of scientists who do public-facing communication for free,” wrote Shannon Osaka, a climate reporter at the Washington Post. “But sometimes the significance of that work is not fully appreciated.”  
&gt;  
&gt;I certainly rely on Swain and other other scientists to tell environmental stories — as do my L.A. Times colleagues on our Climate California desk. Those scientists spend time on the phone with us explaining their research, and out in nature showing us firsthand what they’re seeing. They answer our follow-up questions and help make sure we get the details right.  
&gt;  
&gt;The problem, in Swain’s view, is that scientists typically aren’t compensated for that crucial work — or for anything else they might do to contribute to solving global warming, beyond publishing studies and hoping people take their work seriously.

As I understand it, this is because people really like gas ranges, and if gas for ranges is installed, then people have a much higher chance of putting in gas dryers, water heaters, and furnaces. 

So by targeting gas stoves, one is making a strategic play for all of the less sexy gas appliances.

Second, many studies appear to be showing a link between the burning of natural gas (especially in ranges/ovens) and asthema in children. This means that there are people whose primary concern is health of children that can be allied with in the fight against the gas companies.

I don't see why this is a play for pushing responsibility to individuals. Yes, large buildings could and should be required to do this at the same time. However, they are being restricted in their use of natural gas as well (eventually) which is a win imho. If other places follow, this could be a significant movement.

I plan on recording and streaming my whole process from concept to finished map product on twitch, and uploading clips to social media. My goal for this is 1) to sharpen my skills to prepare for an eventual career in environmental science/GIS and 2) make content for other students (and professionals) who don’t necessarily have the experience I do but still want to do stuff with maps and data. 

I will be cross-posting this post to several other subreddits to get as many ideas as possible.

I have struggled with this, but my answers, for whatever they are worth, are different than the others'.  They will not ring true to some, but please note, I am not trying to harm the discussion, I have walked this particular talk for several decades:

My opinion has always been that the most effective and to-the-point way to be an activist for addressing the climate crisis is to focus on installing penalties (at government levels) for polluting (i.e.: taxes and smart regulations), and incentives for cleanup of the pollution (such as a price that could be paid by government or others per ton for removal of carbon atoms from the atmosphere).  A key point to me, about this approach to activism, is that it would provide accurate price signals to everyone in a market economy, allowing them to equate economizing on funds with reducing polluting.  In conjunction with this, I think there is a different way to orient one's life around different definitions of morality and doing good (bringing happiness) or doing wrong (along with feelings of guilt),.  One of the key aspects of this is that it can be argued that doing good involves selfishly and smartly minding one's work, finances and yes, community activity, such that one is supporting one's self, one's family, one's friends and loved ones, and one's community and views.  Yes, supporting community causes (and choosing one's battles, mindful of the reality that someone who tries to do literally everything will accomplish little or nothing) that one feels strongly about may (or may not?) indeed fall well within such a view of morality, but the main idea here is that it is overall a very different approach to things that (as I see it) does not define self ""sacrifice"" as right, but deeply wrong.

Even if one regards everything I've said about morality and where good feelings come from as ridiculous/awful/etc. (and I'm sure many will), if we focus on the common ground that we all share (wanting quite strongly to do something about the climate emergency/crisis) then I hope my point will be considered that it is arguable the most effective way to do this is not a topus of moral finger-pointing and self-recrimination, but the installation of market mechanisms with teeth to them, such that polluting behavior (our own and others') becomes synonymous with financially costly behavior.  In the case of deadly pollution, should at some point become imprisonable behavior.

When over the years I have seen so many people holding themselves to walking the talk, and equating this in a strong way with carrying out low carbon lifestyles to the best of their abilities, along with advocating that others do so, I have had mixed feelings.  I also have done some of this (have spent a lot of effort and time and money on solar, EV, home efficiency measures, some personal practice modification, etc.).  However, I think at least some of this approach and thinking plays into the hands of the bad guys.  This came somewhat to a head for me when in 2007 the Vice President of the US scoffed at conservation as a ""personal virtue"" but not a sound basis for energy policy.  Personal conservation that is not helped by policy can be regarded as a personal virtue, but I believe it has for too long been regarded as something the opponents of action on climate change use as a manipulation point.  They are happy to see activists-for-change feeling guilty about and focusing on personal conservation to the exclusion of focusing on defining and advocating for rational government action. In a deadly pollution crisis, strong clear rational community and government measures will include penalties and rewards, and will specifically not expect personal-virtue-focused conservationists to somehow overcome the deadly threat on their own.

The opponents of action on climate change will usually argue that installing government measures is a costly thing to do in violation of free market principles.  I'd respond by saying that free market principles are undermined by failure of government to take action when life and property are threatened by polluting behavior.  The opponents of government climate change action are, in my opinion, the ones who are undermining our property-rights-based capitalistic system, not us activists-for-action.

Again, I realize this post will probably rub some folks the wrong way, but I hope it will be received as an ingenuous attempt to lay out what I think in response to an ingenuous question.

addendum to add:
I think you have raised one of the most important topics, if not the most important topic, in our activism to address the climate emergency.  Why does each of us do this?  While my own motives may be somewhat different than others, I think many of us will agree that a rational society (or planet) of intelligent beings, upon discovering a major environmental threat to millions or billions of lives, and hundreds of Trillions of dollars in property, would take clear effective actions to address the threat.  All of us are taking the most effective actions we can think of, in the best ways we can manage, to address this matter.  This still leaves the matter open that we may have disagreement (hopefully discussed constructively here or there) as to the right way or most effective way to go about things, and some of our personal motives may include very different approaches, but I think talking about all of this amongst ourselves can be helpful.","action","2024-02-12 15:21:40","1andle9","melville48",0,1,0,"True","2021-05-12 19:26:03",73,379,2844,936,4232,20,"I try to live my life as climate conscious as possible, almost vegan (pretty much vegan except for the occasional dairy product), try not to mindlessly consume, limit my plastic intake as much as possible, only take public transport/walk, but everytime i slip up or do something that wouldn’t be considered good i feel such immense guilt, i know realistically my one action will not make a difference, but if everyone thinks that way then there is no difference.

I disagree with their conclusion though. ECS is really the first thing we need to have a handle on if we want to make informed decisions. Of course we should just decarbonize ASAP regardless.

Hi everyone, I’m passionate about inspiring and entertaining ways to combat climate change resistance in our culture. I firmly believe this is as much a cultural problem as it is an economic, technical, and political one. To that end, I believe we need more climate change representations in all forms of art and media.

Amazon chose my climate change sci-fi adventure as a featured deal this past May, and the book reached Amazon’s Top 100 last year.

I've posted this in a more interview like and better format.

Enjoy.


Q1. ""Could you tell us in detail which RCP we're following?""

Ans: "" We aren't following a single RCP through and through. RCPs are scenarios, you don't copy-follow a scenario. You're question should be which RCP are we closest to? In my view, considering the fact that RCPs diverge in the mid 2020s, on the basis of their emissions scenarios, we'd follow RCP4.5 closely either a little above or below, probably above, emissions wise, concentrations depends on other elements. 

I think we'll land up around  ~ 2C degrees by 2100, maybe with overshoot. I'd say 1.8 to 2.2 is the range.  

Q2. ""RCP4.5 gets us to 2 -2.4 C, your range is a bit lower why?""

Ans: ""Negative emissions.""

Q3. ""Do you think DAC will ever scale up substantially?""

Ans: ""Depends on what you mean by substantially. I think it can go to a good enough level, and will play a key role, however, if you mean substantial as in we'll remove more than we emit at current levels, I.e. 40GT, I don't think that'd be possible by 2050. And I'm being mild here. Maybe 12-15GT, optimistically.

Q4. ""Net-Zero by 2050?""

Ans: ""I don't know, tad bit optimistic in my opinion. You're gonna need either zero emissions (not possible by 2050), or substantial reductions, such that negative emissions cancel them out. Now, that depends on stuff like scale and how much reduction can we really undergo in, 25 years. I hope it happens, but I'm unsure.""

Q5. ""Which areas of the world could be uninhabitable?""

Ans: ""There's a difference between survivability and liveability. I've heard some exaggerated examples of places/countries becoming uninhabitable. I read this paper which you shared, 

https://www.ft.com/content/072b5c87-7330-459b-a947-be6767a1099d

The first problem I have with this paper is that it doesn't specify what it's saying, the black areas have temps. greater than 28 degrees celsius. 6 - 28 degrees is the niche humans developed in. Humans in 10,000 BC ≠ Humans in 2023. Simple. With advancements, we can survive in most climates. 

The second is RCP 8.5. I agree that we shouldn't discount RCP 8.5, but in the paper, we also see a more plausible RCP 4.5, still bad, but not apocalyptic, mind you. No one focused on that.

RCP 8.5 thinks we'll keep emitting throughout the century and only increasing emissions. That won't happen. 

I'll discuss this more after you've ended your questions.



These assumptions miss out on 3 critical points.

1. Technology. Technology enabled us to survive on the moon. It sent us through deep oceans. It made areas previously uninhabitable, such as deserts, into bustling cities. IMHO we undermine how much tech can develop in 25 years time. 

2. Wealth. If you have wealth you can survive basically anywhere. Guys in hot nations have ACs. Guys in cold nations have heat pumps. Climate Change is, as much as I hate to say it, an engineering problem for the rich and middle class and a existential crisis for the poor.

3. Government Stability. If you have a government which has the capacity to enable desalination, geoengineer rains, etc. You're gonna be much better off. 

So it's not about uninhabitability, it's about engineering and suitability. You're still not gonna have people wanting to live in too hot areas.


Q6. ""Mass Migrations?""

Ans: "" Mass migrations will happen mostly intra-border. I don't see intra-border Mass migrations occuring. People often point to Syria, tell me how many reached Europe? Very small minority, most remained in Turkey. 

I'll take my native India for example. 

For India as a nation, it's an engineering crisis, not an existential one. For India's poor, unfortunately, it is an existential crisis, but for India, no. India has varied Koppen classifications, so you'll see population shuffling internally. And India has the money to geoengineer it's climate.

For less fortunate countries, it's about adaptability. If they can, they'll be spared.

For Small Island Developing Nations. I'm sorry.

Q 7. ""Is a Ministry For The Future like- scenario from the first chapter likely?

Ans: ""India-specific, I think unlikely,
 or not to that extent. I am affiliated with the government to an extent. They're already incrasingly aware of this and are developing Heat Action Plans. I've asked them to also include orders of dispersion, I.e leaving the area of natural catastrophe.

Wet Bulb reaching 35 Degree Centigrade, would need prolonged exposure to kill a healthy human. Prolonged meaning 6 hours, even under RCP8.5 we don't reach it. However, even lower wet bulb temps are still quite/significantly deadly, especially for the vulnerable. 

Not sure about the rest of the world.""

Q8. "" Are you optimistic or pessimistic? A few guys on reddit said you sounded optimistic.""

Ans: ""Me as an individual, I'm on neither side, I'm more go with the flow types. However, me as a climate scientist, I see a treacherous path but I'm confident we can find a way out.

From my experience, people tend to be immensely pessimistic about the climate crisis, I think with some good reason. For many people, life's not great, cost of living, ethnic and racial tensions, lack of money, and now this. This contributes to their nihilism. I'm not a science communicator, I' a scientist, I'm not going to be the best at words. 

I think a lot of their pessimism has to do with how the media handles the crisis. It obviously plays a role, and the media is notoriously bad at portraying the real picture. It'll either deny climate change or expel doomer narratives. My view is that doomerism/denialism are both sides of the same coin. Both peddled by the Fossil fuel industry.  Deniers will say it's normal and doomers will say nothing can be done, which both lead to weakened climate movements. Being realistic means that you recognise that the Earth is undergoing breakdown, but you also recognise that it's not imperative that we're f**cked. This breakdown is stoppable, repairable, and in some ways reversible. Don't fall pray to the Fossil industry's tactics of doom and denial. Outcry and make you voice be heard. That's how you solve this- very much in our hands- crisis.""

""Now for RCP 8.5 vs the rest of the RCPs. Bluntly, it's gonna be around RCP 4.5. RCP 8.5 &amp; 2.6 are basically not possible now. Maybe 2.6 with solar geoengineering, which I do see happening soon enough. 

Feedbacks won't get us to RCP 8.5. There's no tipping point as such, only tipping elements which increase the burden on us.

However, 2.6 has also been stuck out by tragic delay IMHO, maybe we'll get to it. 1.9 was fantasy.

So RCP 4.5 is where we're headed. RCP 6 is also very unlikely in this era of decarbonization. But you cannot rule out RCP 6 concentrations wise.""

As someone who currently works in the environmental industry (environmental consulting) take articles like these with a grain of salt. Yes, the industry is growing, but no where close to the rate at new graduates are being produced.

Over the past decade, I’d say the industry has grown by about 40%. However, the number of graduates in environmental science has quadrupled. It’s more difficult than ever to find an entry-level environmental position. For example, my firm hired two entry-level consultants in the spring. In a two week span, we had 200 applicants for the position. Some really good candidates were rejected, just because of the numbers game.

Where the industry needs the most help is the mid-career professional; those who can step right in and run projects. The “boomers” already got a foot out the door for retirement, and there’s a large gap with those who can replace them. If you’re an environmental professional with 8 - 15 years of experience &amp; some certifications (PE, PG, CIH) firms are climbing over each other to hire you. And if you aren’t an “environmental” professional, there’s still opportunities in back office positions (think accounting, finance, marketing, HR) at environmental firms that need to be filled.

I bring this up because it’s great to see a lot of interest in “green” careers, but temper it with some reality. Check the sister sub at [r/environmental_careers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Environmental_Careers/)to see some of the difficulties people encounter.

The case further alleges the agency allows this pollution “despite knowing the harm it causes to children’s health and welfare.” The case was filed Sunday night in US District Court in the Central District of California.

“There is one federal agency explicitly tasked with keeping the air clean and controlling pollution to protect the health of every child and the welfare of a nation—the EPA,” said Julia Olson, chief legal counsel for Our Children’s Trust, in a statement. “The agency has done the opposite when it comes to climate pollution and it’s time the EPA is held accountable by our courts for violating the US Constitution and misappropriating its congressionally delegated authority.”

The defendants in the case include current EPA Administrator Michael Regan. Regan is presiding over a period of the EPA aggressively attempting to rein in planet-warming pollution from vehicles, power plants and the oil and gas industry.

The E.P.A. can do without its Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights.

Press: https://eos.org/articles/ocean-vessels-may-trigger-lightning-strikes

Open-Source Paper: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EA002926

Amazingly:

Lightning is 15× more likely to occur at a ship location compared to 2 km away. 

Lightning is 66× more likely to occur at a ship location compared to 25 km away. 

Some ships seem to attract huge numbers of lightning strikes compared to others. For example:

“The vessel with the most lightning encounters was the Shelby Courtney, which operates around Gulf Coast Louisiana and was within 2 km of 449 WWLLN strokes during the 3-year period. The second vessel by stroke count is the 187 m cargo ship Bahama Spirit with 444 close lightning encounters. Cargo and tanker ships account for 5 of the top 25 vessels in Table 1, while there are also 3 tugs, 1 dredger, and 1 fishing boat. There are no pleasure craft or sailing ships in Table 1, but the top 25 ships by close lightning encounters do include 3 cruise ships: the Disney Dream with 413 strokes, the Disney Fantasy with 290 strokes, and the Carnival Pride with 270 strokes. The variety of vessel sizes and categories in Table 1 suggests that the amount of time spent sailing in lightning-prone regions is the primary driver of close lightning encounters. All of these vessels spent hundreds of days at sea over the 3-year period, and the hundreds of WWLLN matches only account for less than 0.3% of the AIS data generated by each vessel.”

This may not have the impact of addressing climate change with the urgency, focus and pace that is required. We have already seen this. It is not sufficient to leave such an existential threat to our country, current citizens, future generations and frankly the world to shifting policy priorities over time from government to government.

From a Departmental, Contracting Authority and a supplier perspective creating binding legal obligations on all parties to absolutely enshrine climate change in designing requirements for service, goods and works and assessing suppliers suitability to contract with the public sector is a minimum requirement. It will enable all parties to invest with confidence, build capability, build expertise and skills to make a positive difference.

If this obligation is enshrined in the Procurement Bill this will require a fundamental and critical shift in behaviour and obligations for all parties involved in public sector procurement and the relevant supply chain. This approach will help ensure that no public spend (taxpayers money) is used in a manner that does not either contribute to positive climate impact or as a minimum stops further contribution to climate change.

At the COP28 in Dubai, UAE, which just ended a few days ago, people still hold on to the fairytale that 1.5C is still a workable threshold. 

Nope.

In a few months, the 12 month sliding average will exceed 1.5C, we will probably hit months above 2C in a few months, and when El Niño fades we are unlikely to ever go back to even 1.5C (we may, for a month or two; hard to say).

Global warming is accelerating like a bat out of hell.

I show how global sulphur emissions are dropping, with the largest spike downward from maritime shipping in 2020. I also show how global atmospheric temperatures and global Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies (SSTA) continue to rise at ever faster rates.

"418293","k0gyccg",1,"This comment here ^ is little more than apologetics for an imperial, First World mode of living, thoroughly unrooted from history and a materialist analysis. In my view, it does not belong in this subreddit, but we can expect the Malthusians to return (as they always do) when capitalism is in crisis.

The imperial core, or Global North, is responsible for 92% of consumption-based CO2 emissions past planetary boundaries (350ppm) since 1850; this has been a continual process of laying waste to the atmospheric commons and reducing crop productivity in some of the regions of the world least responsible for trashing the atmospheric commons or the broader ecosystem. 
Moreover, 1% of the global population is responsible for more CO2 emissions than the bottom half of humanity, so the issue is one of *class* and *social relations of production* rather than raw population numbers. 

India's (and China's) emissions may have risen considerably in very recent decades, but these parts of the globe (and the Global South in general) have long existed (and continue to exist) in a system of unequal exchange and appropriation of surplus value by the Global North (a degree of appropriation sufficient to end poverty many times over), sharply constraining the technoscientific possibilities available to the Global South -- while the First World, full of hubris, believes that regions whose land, labor, and resources are exploited are somehow magically supposed to be curtailing emissions, all while insane levels of consumption in the First World continue unabated and the devastating ecological consequences displaced onto the Third World.

SS: From the tell no bullshit James Hansen...

Global warming in the pipeline is greater than prior estimates. Eventual global warming due to today's GHG forcing alone -- after slow feedbacks operate -- is about 10°C.

I am not sure what I can add, if there is a lack of understanding on how the CURRENT EMITTED GHGs will lead to an inevitable 10C temp rise, there not much I can add.  Several climate scientists insist 2C mean the collapse of civilisation as it will cascade to at least 4C, this posits we're already past the point of no return ad we WILL get to 10C, that's a human extinction level event, far beyond the purview of collapse I guess.
I’d normally dismiss this, but this is James Hansen who made the paper, the godfather of climate science, that name alone lends some weight.

One of the main concerns with the models revolves around the kind of futures they end up representing and foregrounding. Grounded in neoclassical economic theory, they employ a linear and reductionist understanding of societal change that is ultimately constrained by the cost-optimising nature of the model and its inbuilt objective to avoid mitigation actions that would be financially disruptive. They tend to prioritize large-scale, simple technological and market-based solutions and generally fall short at capturing factors that are less easy to model or quantify. Systemic, uncertain, or contested aspects—often relating to social, political, and ethical issues and trade-offs between different mitigation measures—are more likely to be excluded.

We can expect to see this any year now. As there is less and less sea-ice in the Arctic, there are now more and more “Marine Heat Waves” MHW events occurring along the outer edges of the Arctic Ocean, expanding in size to deeper waters, extending to longer and longer durations (103 days in 2020), and increasing to hotter and hotter Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) (4C in 2020).

I chat about the most recent science on the Arctic Sea Ice and these Arctic Marine Heat Waves.

“Abstract
Observed Arctic sea ice losses are a sentinel of anthropogenic climate change. These reductions are projected to continue with ongoing warming, ultimately leading to an ice-free Arctic (sea ice area less than 1 million  km2). In this Review, we synthesize understanding of the timing and regional variability of such an ice-free Arctic. In the September monthly mean, the earliest ice-free conditions (the first single occurrence of an ice-free Arctic) could occur in 2020–2030s under all emission trajectories and are likely to occur by 2050. However, daily September ice-free conditions are expected approximately 4 years earlier on average, with the possibility of preceding monthly metrics by 10 years. Consistently ice-free September conditions (frequent occurrences of an ice-free Arctic) are anticipated by mid-century (by 2035–2067), with emission trajectories determining how often and for how long the Arctic could be ice free. Specifically, there is potential for ice-free conditions in May–January and August–October by 2100 under a high-emission and low-emission scenario, respectively. In all cases, sea ice losses begin in the European Arctic, proceed to the Pacific Arctic and end in the Central Arctic, if becoming ice free at all. Future research must assess the impact of model selection and recalibration on projections, and assess the drivers of internal variability that can cause early ice-free conditions.”

4) “Arctic marine heatwaves forced by greenhouse gases and triggered by abrupt sea-ice melt”
https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01215-y.pdf

“Abstract
Since 2007, unprecedented marine heatwave events are occurring over the Arctic Ocean. Here we identify the fraction of the likelihood of Arctic marine heatwaves magnitude that is attributable to greenhouse gas forcing. Results reveal that Arctic marine heatwaves are primarily triggered by an abrupt sea-ice retreat, which coincides with the maximum downward radiative fluxes. Up to 82% of the sea surface temperature variability over the shallow Arctic marginal seas, where marine heatwaves are prone to occur, can be explained by net accumulation of seasonal surface heat flux in the ocean. Event attribution analysis demonstrates that the 103-day long 2020 event – the most intense (4 ∘C) recorded so far in the Arctic – would be exceptionally unlikely in the absence of greenhouse gas forcing in terms of both intensity and duration. Our further results imply that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, along with the expansion of first-year ice extent, moderate marine heatwaves in the Arctic will very likely persistently reoccur.”

Todays politicians, activists etc are doing more harm when it comes to climate change, then good.

The right parties and beliefs (i myself lean toward the right political side) straight up ignores the topic, and the left politicians go about it in the wrong way. Same goes for activists.

I studied this topic for years during my years in trade school and held two presentations about in two schools, each took several months of prep, and 6 hours of interesting presentation. I provided many good ideas and solutions, aswell as ways to solve it realistically.

The issue with climate change politics is that its either ignored, or its stated that we need to stop man-made (or artificially accelerated) climate change. This is the wrong way of thinking. We need to work with climate change. Its happening faster then we thought, and our ecosystems (currently mediterranean climate zones are affected stronger) cant adapt fast enough.

Our flora and fauna is dying rapidly because of strong weather extremes and changes, and in order to help it adapt, new plants, previously even considered invasive (some, not all or most) aswell as new animals (first and foremost insects, but not only) need to be introduced and accustomed. We have to reforest and change our woodlands, need to introduce way more flora into our cities and towns, and we have to start building smarter.

We dont have to sacrifice alot, just a tiny bit, of our lifestyle in order to adapt and live alongside nature. The internal combustion engine for one cannot cease to exist yet if we wanna ""fight"" climate change, we need it. And we need plastic, it is quite essential in our daily lives.

Hi all!

TW: tiny bit graphic, discussion of infections

I recently came across the news about what’s currently going on in Montevideo, Uruguay. Unsurprisingly, i havent seen much coverage on my country’s media, but it’s gotten me terrified for a particular reason.

I suffer from urine, bladder AND kidney infections all at the same time. When I was born, urine somehow built up to damage the other 2 organs, so now i have an inflated bladder and one kidney working 12%, the other 88% or thereabouts. This obviously means that i need a LOT of water, much more than the average human, but then comes the issue of the climate crisis. 

For reference, I live in the somewhat rural UK. How will our water supplies be affected? Will cities like London succumb to the same problem as those poor Uruguayans? Because if it does, I may be in an even more awful position..

If it does come to it, what the hell can i do to help it in this situation? (Eg; get wate)

(Also please no mention of water wars, that stuff gives me ridiculous anxiety)

"200242","kiy2h52",1,"I imagine some crops are enjoying the warmer/wetter/sunnier weather, and overall yields could continue to trend that way as temperatures continue to trend up.  Again, in *certain* crops, in *certain* regions.  I’m sure there are plenty of exceptions where crop outputs will prove to be more sensitive to fluctuations in temperature and rainfall than others, but if we’re talking about global yields, it’s very feasible that the aggregate increases in production in places where crops have benefitted from it being a few degrees warmer are still offsetting decreased yields in regions that have become too warm, too precarious, too wet, or too dry to support the kinds of yields seen historically.  

A lot of modern agricultural advancements have been in our ability to “encourage” plants to grow in places they wouldn’t be suited to otherwise (e.g, through genetic engineering, irrigation, fertilizers, hydroponics, etc.). Many of the plant species we rely on most heavily today (e.g. corn, flax, wheat, rice) originated in regions/conditions that are warmer/more temperate than where they’re primarily grown today (e.g. the “bread basket of America” is a far cry from ancient Mesopotamia, climatically). Agricultural lifestyles became the norm during the Holocene Climatic Optimum — a period of warmer global temperatures between 10,000 - 5,000 years ago — which is also when humans first began to cultivate many of the mainstay crops we still rely on. In other words, much of what we grow today was originally far better suited to survive in environments that were very different from the environments where it’s grown today (granted, more recent changes in various species that we’ve induced through various GE practices and industrial-grade fertilizers/insecticides…. complicate things a bit, here…). 

During the Medieval Warm Period (MEP; when Northern Europe is believed to have experienced an average regional sea-surface temperature increase of about 1 degree C, between 900 and 1250 AD), French nobles had to ban imports of wine from England (historically, not an ideal environment for growing grapes) out of fears that it would disrupt the wine industry in France (and, even a thousand years ago, French attitudes towards English cuisine weren’t far off from what we see today — i.e…. sweeping contempt, lol; this was definitely an ego-check for the French, and likely helped drive the Hundred-Years War).  We may be able to mitigate some of the agricultural shortfall by similarly shifting our established growth-regions for certain crops northward, but it’s worth noting that temperature increases during the MEP seem to have been more regional, more gradual, and far less extreme than the trends painted by present statistics.  Although farmers who lived during the MEW had far less technology to mitigate (or even measure) the changes in climate they experienced, relative to modern agriculturalists, they were still able to adapt because they had more time to accommodate a less drastic shift (the fact that economy of medieval England was far less convoluted/entangled than the modern, globalized system helped, too). Still, *to some extent*, it’s likely we’ll see similar scenarios play out in today’s world as temperatures continue to rise — especially in nations that can afford to bankroll the necessary research and infrastructural/industrial developments as overhauling domestic agricultural practices proves to be an (increasingly dire) imperative. 

“Salvation by innovation” has been our life raft for at least as long as humans have been humans (*Homo sapiens* weren’t even the first humans to use fire; that accolade belongs to *Homo erectus*, as early as 2 million years ago; the oldest stone tools used by early humans date to as early as &gt;3 million years ago). That said, all human innovation up to this point has been driven by a relative abundance of easily-accessible natural resources (fossil fuels, metals, minerals, water, fertile soil, forests with plenty of old-growth timber, oceans with plenty of fish). The last half of the last century in particular has seen us burn through any of the “low hanging fruit” that remained of our natural resources; future innovation will have to take entirely new directions, using different materials and fuel sources than the ones we’ve built our current civilization with and oriented our current economy around. In other words, not only are we facing problems we don’t know how to fix— we also can’t count on using the tools and technologies we know best as a solution (at least not indefinitely).

Again, while we may be able to adapt or even course correct *to some extent*— the climatic “point of no return” is definitely out there: we don’t know exactly where or when, but we know we’re closer to it than we were ten years ago… and last year… and this morning, for that matter. Not to get too doomy. 

That being said… crop resilience can only accommodate a pretty narrow window of fluctuation in climate trends. Policy reforms and technological breakthroughs to mitigate current trends are possible… thus far, however, even when deemed “successful,” such measures have primarily been leveraged to buy time for us to continue kicking the proverbial can o’ worms *just far enough* down the road to figure out another stopgap before kicking it again. (Rinse; repeat.) Furthermore, we’ll have to develop entirely new technologies that don’t require tapping into already-strained resources to address these problems.

Lastly… data is easily manipulated. Big-picture, long-term data on a highly-politicized topic that most people have a high-school-level understanding of (at best) is even more easily manipulated.  We’ll see plenty of misleadingly optimistic reports… until things get undeniably “bad enough” that the majority of people are no longer able to wave it off as “fake news.” Whether that’s “sooner” or “later” will determine how much of a runway we’ll have to take meaningful action to save what we can.","science","2024-01-21 21:32:33","19bf6ui","PhilosopherCareful79",0,1,0,"True","2021-07-15 08:48:58",0,0,3,62,65,35,"","Are global harvests keeping pace in a warming world?",0.92,35,0,"2024-01-20 16:13:40"

This is my field, for decades. Many reputable people in the field believe we are already across tipping points to ecological and societal collapse. There is no room — none — for allowing what we are doing to continue simply because change is hard. 

Of course it’s hard. It’s hard in the same way turning multiple countries around to mobilize to defeat Nazi Germany was hard. It’s hard in the way shutting down almost overnight to protect each other from COVID was hard. Both looked impossible, and they were not. We humans achieved those things because of what was at stake.

What we need is fierce honesty about what is coming, and an abandonment of delays and distractions. We have squandered over 30 years on such distractions. 

For me, this includes any idea that geoengineering could save us. We are headed off a cliff, and the geoengineering approach is a bet that we will somehow learn to fly in time. This isn’t a children’s movie in which cars suddenly sprout wings. That bet is (for me) a dangerous false hope that is unworthy of the crisis.

They understand that environmental concerns are over arching ones and that you have to see climate action as a lens through which to view other issues.  They have established some good long term policies and programs to help curb emissions.

But, they are hideously out of touch with Canadians and aren’t listening.

Which is why I am in two minds about voting against them.  I don’t want to enable the Cons, because that would be completely devastating for Canada’s climate action plan.  We would end up without one and have to start from scratch in however long it would be to another change.

I don’t think the modern NDP has anything different to offer, or at least not different enough to risk a swing to the Cons.   I mean, we are at a pinnacle moment in the balance of power between workers and authority, they should be revelling in it, and yet they are away on leave.

"431839","ju1sc45",1,"Looking at earth as a closed system, the only thing that matters is albedo. The more energy you reflect back into space, the less stays here on earth, so compared to a dark ground, a white tarp will reflect more energy. Compared to light ground, a dark tarp will ABSORB more energy, even though it shades the area underneath it now heats up the air above the tarp.

But this is not the full story. Trees are best for shade, even though they are relatively dark. The reason is that trees don't just heat up from the sun, they USE the energy to convert carbon from the air into a solid form (wood, leaves). This process basically traps the energy in a solid form, it is by far the simplest method of ""carbon capture"" (the idea that we could actively remove carbon from the athmosphere instead of just avoiding its creation). All the energy released from a burning piece of wood *was originally sunbeams captured by the tree*.

So with a tarp you can make a bit of a difference, but mainly the heat will just go somewhere else. With a tree, the energy gets trapped semi-permanently - until the wood decomposes or is burned.","action","2023-07-30 08:08:28","15cyr19","Skatterbrayne",0,1,0,"True","2016-12-29 07:44:36",669,387,1226,49666,51948,16,"Hi, everyone!  I 'm having a hard time finding my exact question answered when searching.  If we shade or otherwise prevent an area of the earth from absorbing heat from the sun, is that heat absorbed on earth somewhere else or some other way?  Or just reflected back into space?  

I'm working on shading a significant portion of my yard.  There are already tree's, but for instant shade in the area where I'm waiting for trees to grow, I'm going to use a combination of pergola and shade sails.  This very clearly keeps the area shaded from getting hot.  I know this and I've measured it.  The difference is significant.  40 to 60 degrees F significant.  

This got me thinking about heat islands and the like.  My assumption is that the areas that are shaded/blocked the heat is reflected back out with some absorbed by the atmosphere.  But, overall, does make the planet cooler.  (yep, I know, small scale, but could be scaled up).  Am I correct, or is there something I'm not considering.  

Where I'm going with this is obviously add shade.  We can even convince some of the climate deniers to add shade because it's hot in their yard in the summer.  I know, scale, and blah, blah.  It's A step.  But right now I'm focused on the mechanical aspect of does shade cool the planet, or just move the heat somewhere else? ","Have a couple of questions",0.91,16,0,"2023-07-29 18:07:53"

That's his main point.

Policymakers, CEOs, financiers etc are listening to economists because

A) economists have decided they know everything about everything (wrong, in fact their own discipline is mainly a sham)

B) it's convenient for this audience to believe the economists and not the scientists because the economists' account is so wildly over-optimistic 

His plan is to have climate scientists peer review the most important (and wrong) economics papers which deal with climate and have the scientists pan the economists' assumptions about losses etc so badly that the relevant journals have to withdraw the papers.","science","2024-03-25 20:07:24","1bnld6s","michaelrch",0,3,0,"True","2018-05-18 09:22:27",1510,149,34582,74191,110432,29,"","Steve Keen on the catastrophic failure of mainstream economics on the consequences of the climate emergency",0.92,29,0,"2024-03-25 18:44:43"

It was 2:48 pm and the show ended at 3:00. I decided to call in,  just for the heck of it. I got through. This particular host hated Obama, with a passion. So I  decided to go fishing in “Lake Obama”.  I asked the host to pretend he was President for the last 8 years and did A,B,C,D. in terms of accomplishments. I asked,” would it be fair to call you a good President.” He said yes. ( I never thought he would take the bait). I told him those 4 things were done by Obama. Oops!  He became irate. He called me a commie, then yelled at his call screener on the air. He told the call screener to block my number. He then asked listeners to call in to confirm I was a commie caller. People  began to call in and he soon realized he forgot the 2:53 commercial break and yelled at the call screener. The show ended and he remained in the studio.  The next host picked up where this guy left off. They were both  furious my call and question had exposed their Obama hate and hypocrisy.","science","2024-02-05 00:22:52","1ai2a0o","Wissotafarms",0,1,0,"True","2023-09-25 03:57:21",0,0,1,4928,4929,148,"","Trump Allies Plan to Gut Climate Research if He Is Reelected - Dozens of conservative organizations have banded together to provide Trump a road map—known as Project 2025—to boost fossil fuels and limit government climate science",0.96,148,0,"2024-02-03 18:11:32"

Unfortunately in Chile there is not too much culture of group meditation and Soto Zen seems to be the most widespread group at least from Zen tradition.

I think all meditative practices can help out with the climate crisis.","action","2023-02-21 02:06:54","116i9m1","AlexSanchezW",0,1,0,"True","2023-02-09 18:32:39",20,0,483,3,506,68,"During my vacations in southern Chile, I spent five days on a meditation retreat.

As I settled into the peaceful surroundings, I couldn’t help but think and write about the wildfires ravaging the country, a stark reminder of the urgent need to address the climate crisis. However, the retreat also provided an opportunity to learn valuable lessons from Zen Buddhism about confronting this crisis with wisdom, compassion, and resilience.

So, here are 4 lessons that Zen Buddhism can teach us about climate:

# 🌍 Lesson #1. Developing a sense of interconnectedness:

One of the critical teachings of Zen is the interdependence and interconnectedness of all things.

This perspective can help us recognize that the actions we take in our daily lives have a ripple effect on the environment and the planet as a whole. By cultivating a sense of interconnectedness with all living beings, we can develop a more profound responsibility for the planet’s well-being.

# 🧘🏻‍♀️ Lesson #2. Cultivating concentration:

Concentration can help us develop a greater awareness of our actions and their environmental impact.

By practicing mindfulness in our daily lives, we can become more attuned to our consumption patterns, waste habits, and other ways we contribute to environmental degradation. This can help us make more conscious choices that reduce our impact on the planet.

# 🍃Lesson #3. Emphasizing simplicity and non-attachment:

Zen emphasizes the importance of clarity and non-attachment to material possessions.

By cultivating a sense of contentment with less, we can reduce our consumption and waste and lessen our environmental impact. This can also help us prioritize the things that truly matter, such as our relationships, health, and connection to nature.

# 🛡️ Lesson #4. Resilience:

Meditation harnesses the ability to maintain a sense of equanimity and inner peace in the face of adversity.

Through the practice of meditation and concentration, Zen practitioners can develop the mental and emotional resilience necessary to navigate the challenges and uncertainties of life, including those posed by climate change.

Overall, the spirit of Zen Buddhism can provide a valuable framework for addressing the climate emergency and cultivating a more profound sense of connection, concentration, frugality, and resilience during climate change times.
